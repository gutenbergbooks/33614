<p><span class="bold">BOHEMIA<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span><a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (Ger. <i>Böhmen</i>, Czech <i>&#268;echy</i>, Lat. <i>Bohemia</i>), a
kingdom and crownland of Austria, bounded N.E. by Prussian
Silesia, S.E. by Moravia and Lower Austria, S. by Upper Austria,
S.W. by Bavaria and N.W. by Saxony. It has an area of 20,060
sq. m., or about two-thirds the size of Scotland, and forms the
principal province of the Austrian empire. Situated in the
geographical centre of the European continent, at about equal
distance from all the European seas, enclosed by high mountains,
and nevertheless easily accessible through Moravia from
the Danubian plain and opened by the valley of the Elbe to the
German plain, Bohemia was bound to play a leading part in the
cultural development of Europe. It became early the scene of
important historical events, the avenue and junction of the
migration of peoples; and it forms the borderland between the
German and Slavonic worlds.</p>

<p><i>Geography</i>.&mdash;Bohemia has the form of an irregular rhomb, of
which the northernmost place, Buchberg, just above Hainspach,
is at the same time the farthest north in the whole Austro-Hungarian
monarchy. From an orographic point of view,
Bohemia constitutes amongst the Austrian provinces a separate
massif, bordered on three sides by mountain ranges: on the
S.W. by the Böhmerwald or Bohemian Forest; on the N.W.
by the Erzgebirge or Ore Mountains; and on the N.E. by the
Riesengebirge or Giant Mountains and other ranges of the
Sudetes. The Böhmerwald, which, like its parallel range, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>122</span>
Sudetes, has a general direction from S.E. to N.W., is divided
by the pass of Neumark into two parts. The northern part (Czech
<i>Cesky Les</i>) attains in the massif of Czerkov an altitude of 3300 ft.,
but the southern part (Czech <i>&#352;umava</i>) is at the same time the
highest and the most picturesque part of the range, including
on the Bohemian side the Osser (4053 ft.) and the Plöckenstein
(4513 ft.), although the highest peak, the Arber (4872), is in
Bavaria. The beauty of this range of mountains consists in its
pure crystalline torrents, in the numerous blue lakes of its valleys,
and above all in the magnificent forests of oak and pine with
which its sides are covered. The pass of Neumark, called also
the pass of Neugedein, has always been the principal approach
to Bohemia from Germany. It stretches towards the east, above
the small town of Taus (Czech <i>Doma&#382;lice</i>, once called <i>Tuho&#349;t</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> the Fortress), and is the place where some of the bloodiest
battles in the history of Bohemia were fought. Here in the first
half of the 7th century Samo repulsed the invading hordes of
the Avars, which threatened the independence of the newly-settled
Slavonic inhabitants; here also Wratislas II. defeated
the German emperor Henry III. in a two-days&rsquo; battle (August
22 and 23, 1040). It was in the same place that the Hussites
gained in 1431 one of their greatest victories against a German
army of crusaders, and another similar German army was vanquished
here by George of Pod&#283;brad.</p>

<p>The Erzgebirge (Czech <i>Rudo Horí</i>), which form the north-west
frontier, have an average altitude of 2600 ft., and as their
highest point, the Keilberg (4080 ft.). The numerous mining
villages, the great number of cultivated areas and the easy
passes, traversed by good roads, give those mountains in many
places the aspect of a hilly undulating plain. Several of the
villages are built very near the summit of the mountains, and
one of them, Gottesgab (pop. about 1500), lies at an altitude of
3345 ft., the highest place in Bohemia and central Germany.
To the west the Erzgebirge combine through the Elstergebirge
with the Fichtelgebirge, which in their turn are united with the
Böhmerwald through the plateau of Waldsassen. To the east
the Erzgebirge are separated from the Elbsandsteingebirge by
the Nollendorf pass, traversed by the ancient military route to
Saxony; it was the route followed by Napoleon I. after the
battle of Dresden (1813). To the south stretches the &ldquo;Thermopylae
of Bohemia,&rdquo; the scene of the battle of Kulm and
Arbesau. A little farther to the east the Elbe escapes into
Saxony at the lowest point in Bohemia (alt. 367 ft.). The north-east
frontier is formed by the Sudetes, which comprise the
Lausitzergebirge (2500 ft.), the Isergebirge (with the highest
peak, the Tafelfichte, 3683 ft.), the Jeschkengebirge (3322 ft.),
and the Riesengebirge. The Riesengebirge (Czech <i>Kroknos&#283;</i>)
are, after the Alps, among the highest mountains of central
Europe, and attain in the Schneekoppe an altitude of 5264 ft.
The last groups of the Sudetes in Bohemia are the Heuscheuergebirge
(2532 ft.) and the Adlergebirge (3664 ft.). The fourth side
of the rhomb is formed by the so-called Bohemian-Moravian
Hills, a plateau or broad series of low hills, composed of primitive
rocks, and attaining in some places an altitude of 2500 ft.</p>

<p>The interior of Bohemia has sometimes been compared to a
deep basin; but for the most part it is an undulating plateau,
over 1000 ft. high, formed by a succession of terraces, which
gradually slope down from south to north. Its lowest-lying
points are not in the middle but in the north, in the valley of the
Elbe, and the country can be divided into two parts by a line
passing through Hohenmauth-Prague-Komotau. The part
lying to the south of this line can be designated as highland, and
only the part north of it as lowland. The mountain-ranges of
the interior of Bohemia are the Brdywald (2798 ft.) in the middle;
the Tepler Gebirge (2657 ft.), the Karsbader Gebirge (3057 ft.)
and the Kaiserwald (3238 ft.), in the north-west part; while the
northern corner is occupied by the Mittelgebirge (2739 ft.), a
volcanic massif, stretching on both sides of the Elbe.</p>

<p>Bohemia belongs to the watershed of the Elbe, which rises
within the territory and receives on the right the Iser and the
Polzen, and on the left the Adler; the Eger with its affluent the
Tepl; the Biela and the Moldau. But the principal river of
Bohemia, from every point of view, is the Moldau (Czech
<i>Vltava</i>), not the Elbe. A glance at the hydrographic structure
of Bohemia, which is of such a striking regularity, shows us that
the Moldau is the main stem, while the Elbe and the other rivers
are only lateral branches; moreover, the Elbe below Melnik,
the point of its confluence with the Moldau, follows the general
direction of the Moldau. Besides, the Moldau is the principal
commercial artery of the country, being navigable below Budweis,
while the Upper-Elbe is not navigable; its basin (11,890 sq. m.)
is twice as great as that of the Elbe, and its width and depth
are also greater. It has a length of 270 m., 47 m. longer than
the Upper-Elbe, but it runs through a deep and narrow valley,
in which there is neither road nor railway, extending from above
Budweis to about 15 m. south of Prague. The Moldau receives
on the right the Lu&#382;niza and the Sazawa and on the left the
Wottawa and the Beraun. The Beraun is formed by the union
of the Mies with the Radbusa, Angel and Uslawa, and is the
third most important river of the country. There are only a few
lakes, which are mostly found at high altitudes.</p>

<p><i>Climate</i>.&mdash;Bohemia has a continental, generally healthy
climate, which varies much in different parts of the country.
It is mildest in the centre, where, <i>e.g.</i> at Prague, the mean annual
temperature is 48.5° F. The rainfall varies also according to the
districts, the rainy season being the summer. Thus the mean
annual rainfall in the interior of Bohemia is 18 in., in the Riesengebirge
40 in., while in the Böhmerwald it reaches 60 to 70 in.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture</i>.&mdash;Favoured with a suitable climate and inhabited
by a thriving rural population, Bohemia is very highly developed
in the matter of agriculture. Over 50% of the whole area is
under cultivation and the soil is in many parts very fertile, the
best-known regions being the &ldquo;Golden Road&rdquo; round Königgrätz,
the &ldquo;Paradise&rdquo; round Teplitz, and the &ldquo;Garden of
Bohemia&rdquo; round Leitmeritz. The principal products are oats,
rye, barley and wheat, but since the competition of Hungarian
wheat large tracts of land have been converted to the cultivation
of beetroot. The potato crop, which forms the staple food of the
people, is great; the Saaz district is celebrated for hops, and the
flax is also of a good quality. Fruit, especially plums, is very
abundant and constitutes a great article of export. The forests
cover 29.01% of the total area; meadows, 10.05, pastures 5.05,
and gardens 1.35%. Cattle-rearing is not so well developed as
agriculture, but great flocks of geese are reared, especially in
the south, and bee-cultivation constitutes another important
industry. Pisciculture has been for centuries successfully
pursued by the Bohemian peasants, and the attempts recently
made for the rearing of silkworms have met with fair success.</p>

<p><i>Minerals</i>.&mdash;Except salt, which is entirely absent, almost
every useful metal and mineral is to be found. First in importance,
both in quantity and in value, come lignite and coal.
Some of the richest lignite fields in Europe are found in the
north-east corner of Bohemia round Brüx, Dux, Falkenau,
Ossegg and Teplitz. Coal is mined round Kladno, Buscht&#283;hrad,
Pilsen, Schlan, Rakonitz, Nürschan and Radnitz, the last-named
place containing the oldest coal mines of Bohemia (17th
century). Iron ores are found at Kru&#349;nahora and Nu&#265;ic, and
the principal foundries are round Kladno and Königshof.
Owing to the improvements in refining, Bohemia has become
an important centre of the iron industry. Silver is extracted
at P&#345;ibram and Joachimsthal, but the silver mines near Kuttenberg,
famous in the middle ages, are now abandoned. Lead is
extracted at P&#345;ibram, tin at Graupen in the Erzgebirge, the only
place in Austria where this metal is found. Antimony is extracted
at Milleschau near Tabor; uranium and radium near Joachimsthal;
graphite near Krumau and Budweis; porcelain-earth near
Carlsbad. Other minerals found in various places of Bohemia
are copper, sulphur, cobalt, alum, nickel, arsenic and various
sorts of precious stone, like the Bohemian garnet (pyrope),
and building stone. A large amount of peat is collected,
especially in the south-west of Bohemia, as well as a great
quantity of asphalt.</p>

<p>Bohemia possesses over two hundred mineral springs, but
only a few are used for medicinal purposes. Among them are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>123</span>
some of the most celebrated mineral springs in the world, such
as Carlsbad, Marienbad, Franzensbad, Teplitz-Schönau and
Bilin. Other springs of importance are Püllna, Sedlitz and
Seidschitz near Brüx; Giesshübl near Carlsbad; Liebwerda,
Königswart, Sangerberg, Neudorf, Tetschen, Johannisbad,
situated at the foot of the Schneekoppe, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Manufactures and Commerce.</i>&mdash;From an industrial point of
view, Bohemia takes the first rank amongst the Austrian provinces,
and at the same time is one of the greatest manufacturing
centres of Europe. Rich as the country is in coal and iron, and
in water supplies which can be transformed into motive power,
the inhabitants were not slow to utilize these advantages, so
that the industry of Bohemia made enormous strides during the
last half of the 19th century. The glass industry was introduced
from Venice in the 13th century and soon attained a vast importance;
the factories are in the neighbourhood of the mountains,
where minerals, and especially silica and fuel, are plentiful.
The finest product, the crystal-glass, is made round Haida and
Steinschönau. The very extensive porcelain industry is concentrated
in and around Carlsbad. The textile industry stands in
the front rank and is mostly concentrated in the north-east
corner of Bohemia, round Reichenberg, and in the valley of the
Lower Elbe. The cloth manufacture is located at Reichenberg;
Rumburg and Trautenau are the centre of the linen industry;
woollen yarns are made at Aussig and Asch. Lace, which is
pursued as a home-industry in the Erzgebirge region, has its
principal centre at Weipert, while Strakonitz has the speciality
of the manufacture of red fezes (Turkish caps). The metallurgic
industries, favoured by the abundance of coal and iron, are
concentrated round the mines. Industrial and agricultural
machinery are manufactured at Reichenberg, Pilsen and Prague,
and at the last-named place is also to be found a great establishment
for the production of railway rolling-stock. Sugar refining
is another industry, which, although of recent date, has had a
very great development, and the breweries produce a beer
which is appreciated all over the world. Other important
branches of industry are:&mdash;the manufacture of chemicals at
Prague and Aussig; pencils at Budweis; musical instruments
at Graslitz and Schönbach; paper, leather, dyeing and
calico-printing. Hand-in-hand with the industrial activity of the
country goes its commercial development, which is stimulated
by an extensive railway system, good roads and navigable
rivers. The centre of the railway system, which had in 1898
a length of some 3500 m., or 30% of the total length of the
Austrian railways, is Prague; and through the Elbe Bohemia
has easy access to the sea for its export trade.</p>

<p><i>Population and Administration.</i>&mdash;Bohemia had in 1900 a
population of 6,318,280, which corresponds to 315 inhabitants
per square mile. As regards numbers, it occupies the second place
amongst the Austrian provinces, coming after Galicia, and as
regards density of population it stands third, Silesia and Lower
Austria, which contains Vienna, standing higher. In 1800 the
population was a little over 3,000,000. According to nationality,
about 35% are Germans and 65% Czechs. The Czechs occupy
the middle of the country, as well as its south and south-east
region, while the Germans are concentrated near its borders,
especially in the north and west, and are also found all over
the country in the large towns. Besides, there are numerous
German-speaking enclaves situated in purely Czech districts;
on the other hand, the Czechs have shown a tendency to invade
the purely German mining and manufacturing districts.
Notwithstanding its rich natural resources and its great industrial
development, Bohemia sends out a steady flow of emigrants,
who either settle in the other provinces of the monarchy, in
Germany and in Russia, or cross the Atlantic to America. To
the Roman Catholic Church belong 96% of the total population;
Bohemia is divided into the archbishopric of Prague, and the
three bishoprics of Budweis, Königgrätz and Leitmeritz.</p>

<p>Education is well advanced, and Bohemia has the lowest
proportion of illiterates amongst the Austrian provinces. At
the head of the educational establishments stand the two
universities at Prague, one German and the other Czech.</p>

<p>Bohemia sends 130 deputies to the Reichsrat at Vienna; the
local diet, to which belong <i>ex officio</i> the archbishop, the three
bishops, and the two rectors of the universities, consists of
242 members. For administrative purposes Bohemia is divided
into ninety-four districts and two autonomous municipalities,
Prague (pop. 204,478), the capital, and Reichenberg (34,204).
Other important towns are Pilsen (68,292), Budweis (39,360),
Aussig (37,255), Schönau (24,110), Eger (23,665), Warnsdorf
(21,150), Brüx (21,525), Gablonz (21,086), Asch (18,675), Kladno
(18,600), Pardubitz (17,029), Saaz (16,168), Komotau (15,925),
Kolin (15,025), Kuttenberg (14,799), Trautenau (14,777),
Carlsbad (14,640), P&#345;ibram (13,576), Jungbunzlau (13,479),
Leitmeritz (13,075), Chrudim (13,017), Dux (11,921), Bodenbach
(10,782), Tabor (10,692), Bohmisch-Leipa (10,674), Rumburg
(10,382), Weipert (10,037).</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">History</p>

<p>The country derives its name from the Boii, a Celtic tribe
which in the earliest historical period inhabited part of the land.
According to very ancient traditions accepted by the modern
historians of Bohemia, the Boii, whose capital was called
Boiohemum, were weakened by continual warfare with neighbouring
tribes, and finally subdued by the Teutonic tribe of the
Marcomanni (about 12 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). The Marcomanni were afterwards
expelled by other Teutonic tribes, and eventually Bohemia was
conquered by Slavic tribes, of whom the &#268;echs (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Czech</a></span>)
were the most important. The date of the arrival of the &#268;echs
in Bohemia is very uncertain, and the scanty references to the
country in classical and Byzantine writers are rather
<span class="sidenote">Slav Conquest.</span>
misleading than otherwise. Recent archaeological
research has proved the existence of Slavic inhabitants
in Bohemia as far back as the beginning of the Christian era.
The &#268;echs appear to have become the masters of the country
in the 5th century. The first of their rulers mentioned in
history is Samo, who is stated to have defeated the Avars, a
Turanian tribe which had for a time obtained the overlordship
over Bohemia. Samo also defeated the Franks in a great battle
that took place at Wogatisburg (630), probably near the site
of the present town of Eger. After the death of Samo the history
of Bohemia again becomes absolutely obscure for about 130
years. The next events that are recorded by the oldest chroniclers,
such as Cosmas, refer to the foundation of a Bohemian principality
by Krok (or Crocus) and his daughter Libussa. The
latter is said to have married P&#345;emysl, a peasant who was found
ploughing his field&mdash;a legend that is common in most Slavic
countries. Beginning with this semi-mythic ruler, the ancient
chroniclers have constructed a continuous list of P&#345;emyslide
princes. Neither the deeds attributed to these princes nor the
dates of their reigns can be considered as historical.</p>

<p>From the time of the introduction of Christianity into Bohemia
the history of the country becomes less obscure. The first
attempts to introduce Christianity undoubtedly came
from Germany. They met with little success, as
<span class="sidenote">Christianity.</span>
innate distrust of the Germans naturally rendered the
Bohemians unfavourable to a creed which reached them from
the realm of their western neighbours. Matters were different
when Christianity approached them from Moravia, where its
doctrine had been taught by Cyrillus and Methodius&mdash;Greek
monks from Thessalonica. About the year 873 the Bohemian
prince Bo&#345;ivoj was baptized by Methodius, and the Bohemians
<span class="sidenote">Wenceslas</span>
now rapidly adopted the Christian faith. Of the
rulers of Bohemia the most famous at this period was
Wenceslas, surnamed the Holy, who in 935 was
murdered by his brother Boleslav, and who was afterwards
canonized by the Church of Rome. As Wenceslas had been an
ally of Germany, his murder resulted in a war with that country,
in which, as far as we can judge by the scanty records of the time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>124</span>
Boleslav, the brother and successor of Wenceslas, was on the
whole successful. During the reigns of Boleslav and his son,
<span class="sidenote">Boleslav.</span>
Boleslav II., Bohemia extended its frontiers in several
directions. Boleslav II. indeed established his rule
not only over Bohemia and Moravia, but also over a large part
of Silesia, and over that part of Poland which is now the Austrian
province of Galicia. Like most Slavic states at this and even
a later period, the great Bohemian empire of Boleslav II. did not
endure long. Boleslav III., son of Boleslav II., lost all his
foreign possessions to Boleslav the Great, king of Poland.
During his reign Bohemia was involved in constant civil war,
caused by the dissensions between Boleslav III. and his brothers
Jaromir and Ulrick. Though the prince succeeded in expelling
his brothers from the country, his cruelty induced the Bohemians
to dethrone him and to choose as their ruler the Polish prince
<span class="sidenote">Vladivoj.</span>
Vladivoj, brother of Boleslav the Great, and son of the
Bohemian princess &#270;ubravka (Dobrawa). Vladivoj
attempted to strengthen his hold over Bohemia by securing the
aid of Germany. He consented not only to continue to pay the
tribute which the Germans had already obtained from several
previous rulers of Bohemia, but also to become a vassal of
the German empire and to receive the German title of duke.
This state continued when after the death of Vladivoj the
P&#345;emyslide dynasty was restored. The P&#345;emyslide prince B&#345;etislav
<span class="sidenote">B&#345;etislav I.</span>
I. (1037-1055) restored the former power of Bohemia,
and again added Moravia, Silesia and a considerable
part of Poland to the Bohemian dominions. To obviate the
incessant struggles which had endangered the land at every
vacancy of the throne, B&#345;etislav, with the consent of the nobles,
decreed that the oldest member of the house of P&#345;emysl should
be the ruler of Bohemia. B&#345;etislav was therefore succeeded
first by his eldest son Spitihn&#283;v, and then by his second son
Vratislav.</p>

<p>In 1088 Vratislav obtained the title of king from the emperor
Henry IV., whom he had assisted in the struggle with the papal
see which is known as the contest about investitures.
Though the title of king was only conferred on Vratislav
<span class="sidenote">Vratislav becomes &ldquo;king&rdquo;.</span>
personally, the German king, Conrad III., conferred
on the Bohemian prince Sobeslav (1125-1140) the
title of hereditary cupbearer of the Empire, thus granting a
certain influence on the election of the emperors to Bohemia,
which hitherto had only obligations towards the Empire but no
part in its government. In 1156 the emperor Frederick I.
Barbarossa ceded Upper Lusatia to the Bohemian prince
Vladislav II., and conferred on him the title of king on condition
of his taking part in Frederick&rsquo;s Italian campaigns. It was
intended that that title should henceforth be hereditary, but
it again fell into abeyance during the struggles between the
P&#345;emyslide princes which followed the abdication of Vladislav
in 1173.</p>

<p>The consequences of these constant internal struggles were
twofold; the German influence became stronger, and the
power of the sovereign declined, as the nobility on whose support
the competitors for the crown were obliged to rely constantly
obtained new privileges. In 1197 P&#345;emysl Ottakar became
undisputed ruler of Bohemia, and he was crowned as king in the
following year. The royal title of the Bohemian sovereigns
was continued uninterruptedly from that date. Wenceslas I.
(1230-1253) succeeded his father as king of Bohemia without
opposition. The last years of his reign were troubled by internal
<span class="sidenote">Ottakar II.</span>
discord. Wenceslas&rsquo;s son, P&#345;emysl Ottakar II., who
under the sovereignty of his father ruled Moravia,
became for a time the chief leader of the malcontents.
A reconciliation between son and father, however, took place
before the latter&rsquo;s death. P&#345;emysl Ottakar II. was one of the
greatest of Bohemia&rsquo;s kings. He had during the lifetime of his
father obtained possession of the archduchies of Austria, and,
about the time of his accession to the Bohemian throne, the
nobility of Styria also recognized him as their ruler. These
extensions of his dominions involved P&#345;emysl Ottakar II. in
repeated wars with Hungary. In 1260 he decisively defeated
Bela, king of Hungary, in the great battle of Kressenbrunn.
After this victory Ottakar&rsquo;s power rose to its greatest height.
He now obtained possession of Carinthia, Istria and parts of
northern Italy. His possessions extended from the Giant
Mountains in Bohemia to the Adriatic, and included almost all
the parts of the present Habsburg empire west of the Leitha.
His contemporaries called Ottakar &ldquo;the man of gold&rdquo; because
of his great wealth, or &ldquo;the man of iron&rdquo; because of his military
power. From political rather than racial causes Ottakar
favoured the immigration of Germans into his dominions. He
hoped to find in the German townsmen a counterpoise to the
overwhelming power of the Bohemian nobility. In 1273
Rudolph, count of Habsburg, was elected king of the Romans.
It is very probable that the German crown had previously been
offered to Ottakar, but that he had refused it. Several causes,
among others his Slavic nationality, which was likely to render
him obnoxious to the Germans, contributed to his decision.
As Rudolph immediately claimed as vacant fiefs of the Empire
most of the lands held by Ottakar, war was inevitable. Ottakar
was deserted by many of his new subjects, and even by part of
the Bohemian nobility. He was therefore unable to resist
the German king, and was obliged to surrender to him all his
lands except Bohemia and Moravia, and to recognize Rudolph
as his overlord. New dissensions between the two sovereigns
broke out almost immediately. In 1278 Ottakar invaded the
Austrian duchies, now under the rule of Rudolph, but was
defeated and killed at the battle of Durnkrut on the Marchfeld.</p>

<p>Ottakar&rsquo;s son, Wenceslas II., was only seven years of age at
the death of his father, and Otto of Brandenburg, a nephew of
Ottakar, for a time governed Bohemia as guardian of
the young sovereign. Otto&rsquo;s rule was very unpopular,
<span class="sidenote">Wenceslas II.</span>
an insurrection broke out against him, and Bohemia
was for a time in a state of complete anarchy. The country
was at last pacified through the intervention of Rudolph of
Habsburg, and at the age of twelve Wenceslas became nominal
ruler of the country. All power was, however, in the hands of
Zavis of Falkenstein, one of the great Bohemian nobles, who
had married the king&rsquo;s mother, Kunegunda. The power of
Zavis at last became invidious to the king, by whose order he
was beheaded in 1290. Wenceslas, though only nineteen years
of age, henceforth governed Bohemia himself, and his short
reign was a period of great happiness for the country. Poland
also accepted the rule of Wenceslas and the Hungarian crown
was offered to him. Towards the end of his reign Wenceslas
became involved in war with Albert, archduke of Austria, afterwards
king of the Romans. While preparing to invade Austria
Wenceslas died suddenly (1305). His son and successor,
Wenceslas III., was then only sixteen years of age, and he only
ruled over Bohemia for one year. While planning a warlike
expedition against Poland, on which country the Bohemian
sovereigns now again maintained their claim, he was murdered
by unknown assassins (1306). With him ended the rule of the
P&#345;emyslide dynasty over Bohemia.</p>

<p>Albert, king of the Romans, declared that Bohemia was a
vacant fief of the Empire, and, mainly by intimidation, induced
the Bohemians to elect his son Rudolph as their sovereign;
but Rudolph died after a reign of only one year. Though the
Habsburg princes at this period already claimed a hereditary
right to the Bohemian throne, the Bohemians determined to
maintain their right of electing their sovereign, and they chose
Henry, duke of Carinthia, who had married a daughter of King
Wenceslas II. Henry soon became unpopular, as he was accused
of unduly favouring the German settlers in Bohemia. It was
decided to depose him, and the choice of the Bohemians now
<span class="sidenote">John of Luxemburg.</span>
fell on John of Luxemburg, son of Henry, king of the
Romans. The Luxemburg dynasty henceforth ruled
over Bohemia up to the time of its extinction at the
death of Sigismund (1437). Though King John, by
his marriage to the princess Elizabeth, a daughter of Wenceslas
II., became more closely connected with Bohemia, he
does not appear to have felt much interest in that country.
Most of his life was spent in other lands, his campaigns ranging
from Italy in the south to Lithuania in the north. It became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>125</span>
proverbial &ldquo;that nothing could be done in the world without
the help of God and of the king of Bohemia.&rdquo; The policy of
John was founded on a close alliance with France, the country
for which he felt most sympathy. Fighting as an ally of France
he fell at the battle of Crécy (1346).</p>

<p>He was succeeded as king of Bohemia by his son Charles,
whom the German electors had previously elected as their
sovereign at Rense (1346). Charles proved one of the
greatest rulers of Bohemia, where his memory is still
<span class="sidenote">King Charles.</span>
revered. Prague was his favourite residence, and by
the foundation of the nové m&#283;sto (new town) he greatly enlarged
the city, which now had three times its former extent, and soon
also trebled its population. He also added greatly to the
importance of the city by founding the famous university of
Prague. Charles succeeded in re-establishing order in Bohemia.
The country had been in a very disturbed state in consequence
of feuds that were incessant during the reign of John, who
had almost always been absent from Bohemia. Charles also
attempted to codify the obscure and contradictory laws of
Bohemia; but this attempt failed through the resistance of
the powerful nobility of the country. During the reign of
Charles, the first symptoms of that movement in favour of
church reform that afterwards acquired a world-wide importance,
appeared in Bohemia. As Charles has often been accused
of undue subserviency to the Church of Rome, it should be mentioned
that he granted his protection to several priests who
favoured the cause of church reform. In his foreign policy
Charles differed from his father. The relations with France
gradually became colder, and at the end of his reign Charles
favoured an alliance with England; he died in 1378 at the
age of sixty-two, prematurely exhausted by arduous work.</p>

<p>Charles was succeeded by his son Wenceslas, who was then
seventeen years of age. His reign marks the decline of the rule
of the house of Luxemburg over Bohemia. He was
a weak and incapable sovereign, but the very exaggerated
<span class="sidenote">Wenceslas IV.</span>
accusations against him, which are found
principally in the works of older historians, are mainly due to
the fact that the king and to a larger extent his queen, Sophia,
for a time furthered the cause of church reform, thus incurring
the displeasure of Romanist writers. During the earlier part of
the reign of Wenceslas a continual struggle took place between
the king and the powerful Bohemian nobles, who indeed twice
imprisoned their sovereign. Wenceslas also became involved
in a dispute with the archbishop, which resulted in the death
of the famous John of Nepomuk.</p>

<p>The later part of the reign of Wenceslas is a record of incipient
religious conflict. The hold of the Church of Rome on Bohemia
had already been weakened during the reign of King
Charles by attacks on the immorality of the clergy,
<span class="sidenote">Huss and the Hussites.</span>
which proceeded from pious priests such as Mili&#263; and
Waldhauser. The church schism, during which the
rival pontiffs assailed each other with all the wild threats and
objurgations of medieval theological strife, necessarily alienated
the Bohemians to a yet greater extent. Almost the whole
Bohemian nation therefore espoused the cause of Huss (<i>q.v.</i>).
Wenceslas on the occasion of these disputes displayed the
weakness and irresolution that always characterized him, but
Queen Sophia openly favoured the cause of Huss, who for some
time was her confessor. Huss was tried before the council
of Constance (<i>q.v.</i>), to which he had proceeded with a letter of
safe conduct given by Wenceslas&rsquo;s brother Sigismund, king of
the Romans. He was declared a heretic and burnt on the 6th
of July 1415. The inevitable and immediate result of this event
was the outbreak of civil war in Bohemia, where Huss was
greatly revered by the large majority of the population. The
nobles of Bohemia and Moravia met at Prague on the 2nd of
September 1415, and sent to the council the famed <i>Protestatio
Bohemorum</i>, in which they strongly protested against the
execution of Huss, &ldquo;a good, just and catholic man who had for
many years been favourably known in the Kingdom by his life,
conduct and fame, and who had been convicted of no offence.&rdquo;
They further declared that all who affirmed that heresy existed
in Bohemia were &ldquo;liars, vile traitors and calumniators of
Bohemia and Moravia, the worst of all heretics, full of all evil,
sons of the devil.&rdquo; They finally stated &ldquo;that they would defend
the law of our Lord Jesus Christ and its pious, humble and steadfast
preachers at the cost of their blood, scorning all fear and all
human decrees that might be contrary to them.&rdquo;<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a> This
protest was a declaration of war against the Roman church,
and marks the beginning of the Hussite wars. The council,
indeed, summoned the nobles before its tribunal, but they
refused to appear. A large number of the nobles and knights
who had met at Prague formed a confederacy and declared
that they consented to freedom of preaching the word of God
on their estates, that they declined to recognize the authority
of the council of Constance, but would obey the Bohemian
bishops and a future pope lawfully elected. Meanwhile they
declared the university of Prague the supreme authority in all
matters of religion. The members of the confederacy attempted,
though unsuccessfully, to induce King Wenceslas to become their
leader. The Romanist nobles, who were not numerous, but
some of whom owned vast estates, now also formed a confederacy,
pledging themselves to support the pope and the council. After
the closing of the council in 1418, Sigismund, who&mdash;Wenceslas
being childless&mdash;was heir to the Bohemian throne, sent a letter
to his brother, which was practically a manifesto addressed
to the Bohemian people. He threatened with the severest
penalties all who should continue to resist the authority of
Rome. Wenceslas maintained the vacillating attitude that
was characteristic of his whole reign, though Queen Sophia still
extended her protection to the reformers. By doing this, indeed,
she incurred the wrath of the Church to so great an extent that
an act of accusation against her was drawn up at the council
of Constance. Intimidated by his brother, Wenceslas now attempted
to stem the current of religious enthusiasm. Immediately
after the death of Huss many priests who refused to
administer communion in the two kinds&mdash;now the principal
tenet of the adherents of Huss&mdash;had been expelled from their
parishes. Wenceslas decreed that they should be reinstated,
and it was only after some hesitation that he even permitted
that religious services according to the Utraquist doctrine should
be held in three of the churches of Prague. Some of the more
advanced reformers left Prague and formed the party known
as the Taborites, from the town of Tabor which became their
centre. Troubles soon broke out at Prague. When on the 30th
of July 1419, the Hussite priest, John of Zelivo, was leading
a procession through the streets of Prague, stones were thrown
at him and his followers from the town hall of the &ldquo;new town.&rdquo;
The Hussites, led by John &#381;i&#382;ka (<i>q.v.</i>), stormed the town-hall and
threw the magistrates from its windows. On receiving the news
of these riots King Wenceslas was immediately seized by an attack
of apoplexy; a second fit on the 16th of August ended his life.</p>

<p>The news of the death of the king caused renewed rioting
in Prague and many other Bohemian cities, from which many
Germans, mostly adherents of the Church of Rome,
were expelled. Finally a temporary truce was
<span class="sidenote">Sigismund.</span>
concluded, and, early in the following year, Sigismund,
who now claimed the Bohemian crown as successor of his brother,
arrived at Kutna Hora (Kuttenberg). Pope Martin V. on the
1st of March 1420 proclaimed a crusade against Bohemia, and
crusaders from all parts of Europe joined Sigismund&rsquo;s army.
&ldquo;On the 30th day of June the Hungarian king, Sigismund, with a
large army consisting of men of various countries, as well as of
Bohemians, occupied the castle of Prague, determined to conquer
the city, which they considered a heretical community because
they used the sacred chalice and accepted other evangelical
truths.&rdquo;<a name="fa3a" id="fa3a" href="#ft3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a> But the attempt of the crusaders to
conquer Prague failed, and after an attack by them on the Vitkov
(now Zizkov) hill had been repulsed by the desperate bravery
of the Taborites, led by &#381;i&#382;ka, Sigismund determined to abandon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>126</span>
the siege of Prague. An attempt of Sigismund to relieve the
besieged garrison of the Vy&#349;ehrad fortress on the outskirts of
Prague also failed, as he was again entirely defeated at the battle
of the Vy&#349;ehrad (November 1, 1420).</p>

<p>Royal authority now ceased in Bohemia. At a meeting of
the diet at Caslav (June 1, 1421) Sigismund was deposed. It
was decided that a Polish prince should be chosen as sovereign,
and that meanwhile a provisional government, composed of
twenty men belonging to the various parties, should be established.
In 1422 Sigismund again invaded Bohemia, but was
decisively defeated by &#381;i&#382;ka at Nêmecký Brod (Deutschbrod).
The Polish prince, Sigismund Korybutovi&#265;, now arrived in
Bohemia, and was recognized as regent by the large majority
of the inhabitants; but through the influence of the papal see
<span class="sidenote">Religious War.</span>
he was recalled by the rulers of Poland after a stay
of only a few months. After his departure, civil
war between the moderate Hussites (Calixtines or
Utraquists) and the advanced Taborite party broke out for the
first time, though there had previously been isolated disturbances
between them. The return of Prince Korybutovi&#265; and the
menace of a German invasion soon reunited the Bohemians,
who gained a decisive victory over the Germans at Aussig in
1426. Shortly afterwards Korybutovi&#265;, who had taken part
in this great victory, incurred the dislike of the extreme Hussites,
and was obliged to leave Bohemia. All hope of establishing an
independent Slav dynasty in Bohemia thus came to an end.
In 1427 several German princes undertook a new crusade against
the Hussites. With the German and other invaders were 1000
English archers, bodyguard to Henry Beaufort, bishop of
Winchester, who took part in the crusade as papal legate.
The crusaders were seized by a sudden panic, both at Mies
(St&#345;ibro) and at Tachau, as soon as they approached the Hussites,
and they fled hurriedly across the mountains into Bavaria.
Though internal disturbances again broke out, the Bohemians
after this success assumed the offensive, and repeatedly invaded
Hungary and the German states.</p>

<p>The impossibility of conquering Bohemia had now become
obvious, and it was resolved that a council should meet at Basel
(<i>q.v.</i>) to examine the demands of the Hussites. The Germans,
however, influenced by Sigismund, determined to make a last
attempt to subdue Bohemia by armed force. The Bohemians,
as usual united in the moment of peril, defeated the Germans at
Doma&#382;lice (Taus) on the 1st of August 1431, after a very short
fight. In the course of the same year negotiations began at
Basel, the Hussites being represented by a numerous embassy
under the leadership of Prokop the Great. The negotiations
proceeded very slowly, and in 1433 the Bohemians returned to
their own country, accompanied, however, by envoys of the
council. Dissensions had meanwhile again broken out in
Bohemia, and they were now of a political rather than a religious
nature. The more aristocratic Hussites raised an armed force
which was known as &ldquo;the army of the nobles.&rdquo; The Taborites
also collected their men, who formed &ldquo;the army of the towns.&rdquo;
The two armies met at Lipan, near Kolin, on the 30th of May
1434. The Taborites were defeated, and the two Prokops and
most of their other leaders perished on the battlefield. The
victory of the moderate party paved the way to a reconciliation
with Sigismund and the Church of Rome. The Bohemians
<span class="sidenote">The &ldquo;Compacts.&rdquo;</span>
recognized Sigismund as their sovereign, but obtained
considerable concessions with regard to religious
matters. These concessions, which were formulated
in the so-called Compacts, granted to the Bohemians the
right of communion in both kinds, and of preaching the gospel
freely, and also to a certain extent limited the power of the clergy
to acquire worldly goods.</p>

<p>After the Compacts had been formally recognized at Iglau in
Moravia, Sigismund proceeded to Prague and was accepted as
king. He died in the following year (1437) and was succeeded
by his son-in-law, Albert of Austria, whom the estates chose as
their king. Albert died after he had reigned over Bohemia less
than two years. Though it was known that Albert&rsquo;s widow
Elizabeth would shortly give birth to a child, the question as to
the succession to the throne again arose; for it was only in 1627
that the question whether the Bohemian crown was elective
or hereditary was decided for ever. The nobles formed two
parties, one of which, the national one, had George of
<span class="sidenote">George of Pod&#283;brad.</span>
Pod&#283;brad (<i>q.v.</i>) as its leader. Ulrich of Rosenberg
was the leader of the Roman or Austrian division of
the nobility. The two parties finally came to an agreement
known as the &ldquo;Letter of Peace&rdquo; (<i>list mirný</i>). Those who signed
it pledged themselves to recognise the Compacts, and to support
as archbishop of Prague, John of Rokycan, who had been chosen
by the estates in accordance with an agreement made simultaneously
with the Compacts, but whom the Church of Rome
refused to recognize. On the other hand, the national party
abandoned the candidature to the throne of Prince Casimir of
Poland, thus paving the way to the eventual succession of
Albert&rsquo;s heir. On the 22nd of February 1440 Queen Elizabeth
gave birth to a son, who received the name of Ladislas. The
Bohemians formally acknowledged him as their king, though
only after their crown had been declined by Albert, duke of
Bavaria. Ladislas remained in Austria under the guardianship
of his uncle Frederick, duke of Styria, afterwards the emperor
Frederick III., and Bohemia, still without regular government,
continued to be the scene of constant conflicts between the rival
parties of the nobility. In 1446 a general meeting of the estates
of Bohemia together with those of Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia&mdash;and
so-called &ldquo;lands of the Bohemian crown&rdquo;&mdash;took place.
This meeting has exceptional importance for the constitutional
history of Bohemia. It was decreed that at the meeting of the
estates their members should be divided into three bodies&mdash;known
as <i>curiae</i>&mdash;representing the nobles, the knights and the
towns. These <i>curiae</i> were to deliberate separately and only to
meet for a final decision. An attempt made at this meeting to
appoint a regent was unsuccessful. The negotiations with the
papal see continued meanwhile, but led to no result, as the
members of the Roman party used their influence at the papal
court for the purpose of dissuading it from granting any concessions
to their countrymen. Shortly after the termination of
the diet of 1446 George of Pod&#283;brad therefore determined to
appeal to the fortune of war. He assembled a considerable army
at Kutna Hora and marched on Prague (1448). He occupied
the town almost without resistance and assumed the regency
over the kingdom. The diet in 1451 recognized his title, which
was also sanctioned by the emperor Frederick III., guardian of
the young king. Pod&#283;brad was none the less opposed, almost
from the first, by the Romanists, who even concluded an alliance
against him with their extreme opponents, Kolda of &#381;ampach
and the other remaining Taborites. In October 1453 Ladislas
arrived in Bohemia and was crowned king at Prague; but he
died somewhat suddenly on the 23rd of November 1457. George
of Pod&#283;brad has from the first frequently been accused of having
poisoned him, but historical research has proved that this
accusation is entirely unfounded. The Bohemian throne was
now again vacant, for, when electing Ladislas the estates had
reaffirmed the elective character of the monarchy. Though
there were several foreign candidates, the estates unanimously
elected George of Pod&#283;brad, who had now for some time administered
the country. Though the Romanist lords, whom Pod&#283;brad
had for a time won over, also voted for him, the election was
considered a great victory of the national party and was welcomed
with enthusiasm by the citizens of Prague.</p>

<p>During the earlier and more prosperous part of his reign the
policy of King George was founded on a firm alliance with
Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary, through whose influence
he was crowned by the Romanist bishop of Waitzen. The
reign of King George, whose principal supporters were the men
of the smaller nobility and of the towns, was at first very prosperous.
After a certain time, however, some of the Romanist
nobles became hostile to the king, and, partly through their
influence, he became involved in a protracted struggle with the
papal see. It was in consequence of this struggle that some of
George&rsquo;s far-reaching plans&mdash;he endeavoured for a time to obtain
the supremacy over Germany&mdash;failed. After the negotiations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>127</span>
with Rome had proved unsuccessful George assembled the
estates at Prague in 1452 and declared that he would to his
death remain true to the communion in both kinds, and that
he was ready to risk his life and his crown in the defence of his
faith. The Romanist party in Bohemia became yet more
embittered against the king, and at a meeting at Zelena Hora
(Grünberg) in 1465 many nobles of the Roman religion joined in
a confederacy against him. In the following year Pope Paul II.
granted his moral support to the confederates by pronouncing
sentence of excommunication against George of Pod&#283;brad and by
releasing all Bohemians from their oath of allegiance to him. It
was also through papal influence that King Matthias of Hungary,
deserting his former ally, supported the lords of the league of
Zelena Hora. Desultory warfare broke out between the two
parties, in which George was at first successful; but fortune
changed when the king of Hungary invaded Moravia and
obtained possession of Brünn, the capital of the country. At a
meeting of the Catholic nobles of Bohemia and Moravia at
Olmütz in Moravia, Matthias was proclaimed king of Bohemia
(May 3, 1469). In the following year George obtained some
successes over his rival, but his death in 1471 for a time put a
stop to the war. George of Pod&#283;brad, the only Hussite king of
Bohemia, has always, with Charles IV., been the ruler of Bohemia
whose memory has most endeared itself to his countrymen.</p>

<p>George of Pod&#283;brad had undoubtedly during the more prosperous
part of his reign intended to found a national dynasty.
In later years, however, hope of obtaining aid from Poland in his
struggle against King Matthias induced him to offer the succession
to the Bohemian throne to Vladislav (Wladislaus, Ladislaus),
son of Casimir, king of Poland. No formal agreement was made,
and at the death of George many Bohemian nobles supported
the claim of Matthias of Hungary, who had already been proclaimed
king of Bohemia. Protracted negotiations ensued, but
<span class="sidenote">Vladislav of Poland.</span>
they ended by the election of Prince Vladislav of
Poland at Kutna Hora, the 27th of May 1471. This
election was a victory of the national party, and
may be considered as evidence of the strong anti-clerical
feeling which then prevailed in Bohemia; for Matthias was an
unconditional adherent of Rome, while the Polish envoys who
represented Vladislav promised that he would maintain the
Compacts. At the beginning of his reign the new king was
involved in a struggle with Matthias of Hungary, who maintained
his claim to the Bohemian throne. Prolonged desultory warfare
continued up to 1478, when a treaty concluded at Olmütz
secured Bohemia to Vladislav; Matthias was to retain the
so-called &ldquo;lands of the Bohemian crown&rdquo;&mdash;Moravia, Silesia
and Lusatia&mdash;during his lifetime, and they were to be restored
to Bohemia after his death. Though Vladislav was faithful to
his promise of maintaining the Compacts, and did not attempt
to prevent the Bohemians from receiving the communion in
both kinds, yet his policy was on the whole a reactionary one,
both as regards matters of state and the religious controversies.
The king appointed as government officials at Prague men of
that section of the Utraquist party that was nearest to Rome,
while a severe persecution of the extreme Hussites known as the
Bohemian Brethren took place (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hussites</a></span>). Serious riots
took place at Prague, and the more advanced Hussites stormed
the three town halls of the city. The nobles of the same faith
also formed a league to guard themselves against the menaced
reaction. A meeting of all the estates at Kutna Hora in 1485,
however, for a time restored peace. Both parties agreed to
respect the religious views of their opponents and to abstain from
all violence, and the Compacts were again confirmed.</p>

<p>As regards matters of state the reign of Vladislav is marked
by a decrease of the royal prerogative, while the power of the
nobility attained an unprecedented height, at the expense, not
only of the royal power, but also of the rights of the townsmen
and peasants. A decree of 1487 practically established serfdom
in Bohemia, where it had hitherto been almost unknown. It is
impossible to exaggerate the importance of this measure for the
future of Bohemia. The rulers of the country were henceforth
unable to rely on that numerous sturdy and independent
peasantry of which the armies of &#381;i&#382;ka and the Prokops had
mainly consisted. Various enactments belonging to this reign
also curtailed the rights of the Bohemian townsmen. A decree
known as the &ldquo;regulations of King Vladislav&rdquo; codified these
changes. It enumerated all the rights of the nobles and knights,
but entirely ignored those of the towns. It was tacitly assumed
that the townsmen had no inherent rights, but only such
privileges as might be granted them by their sovereign with
the consent of the nobles and knights. Civil discord was the
inevitable consequence of these enactments. Several meeting?
of the diet took place at which the towns were not represented.
The latter in 1513 formed a confederacy to defend their rights,
and chose Prince Bartholomew of Münsterberg&mdash;a grandson of
King George&mdash;as their leader.</p>

<p>Vladislav was elected king of Hungary in 1490 and many of
the events of his later life belong to the history of Hungary. He
married in 1502 Anna de Candale, who was connected
with the royal family of France. He had two children
<span class="sidenote">Louis.</span>
by her, Anna, who afterwards married the archduke Ferdinand
of Austria, and Louis. Vladislav died in Hungary in 1516. His
successor was his son Louis, who had already been crowned as
king of Bohemia at the age of three. According to the instructions
of Vladislav, Sigismund, king of Poland, and the emperor
Maximilian I. were to act as guardians of the young king. The
Bohemian estates recognized this decision, but they refused to
allow the guardians any right of interference in the affairs of
Bohemia. The great Bohemian nobles, and in particular the
supreme burgrave, Zden&#283;k Leo, lord of Ro&#382;mital, ruled the
country almost without control. The beginning of the nominal
reign of King Louis is marked by an event which had great
importance for the constitutional development of Bohemia. At
a meeting of the estates in 1517 known as the diet of St Wenceslas&mdash;as
the members first assembled on the 28th of September, the
anniversary of that saint&mdash;they came to terms and settled the
questions which had been the causes of discord. The citizens
renounced certain privileges which they had hitherto claimed,
while the two other estates recognized their municipal autonomy
and tacitly sanctioned their presence at the meetings of the diet,
to which they had already been informally readmitted since 1508.
At the first sitting of this diet, on the 24th of October, it was
declared that the three estates had agreed henceforth &ldquo;to live
together in friendly intercourse, as became men belonging to the
same country and race.&rdquo; In 1522 Louis arrived in Bohemia from
Hungary, of which country he had also been elected king. On his
arrival at Prague he dismissed all the Bohemian state officials,
including the powerful Leo of Ro&#382;mital. He appointed Charles
of Münsterberg, a cousin of Prince Bartholomew and also a
grandson of King George, as regent of Bohemia during his
absences, and John of Wartenberg as burgrave. The new
officials appear to have supported the more advanced Hussite
party, while Ro&#382;mital and the members of the town council of
Prague who had acted in concert with him had been the allies of
the Romanists and those Utraquists who were nearest to the
Church of Rome. The new officials thus incurred the displeasure
of King Louis, who was at that moment seeking the aid of the
pope in his warfare with Turkey. The king therefore reinstated
Leo of Ro&#382;mital in his offices in 1525. Shortly afterwards
Ro&#382;mital became involved in a feud with the lords of Rosenberg;
the feud became a civil war, in which most of the nobles and
cities of Bohemia took sides. Meanwhile Louis, who had
returned to Hungary, opened his campaign against the Turks.
He requested aid from his Bohemian subjects, and this was
granted, by the Rosenberg faction, while Ro&#382;mital and his party
purposely delayed sending any forces to Hungary. There were,
therefore, but few Bohemian troops at the battle of Mohács
(August 29, 1526) at which Louis was decisively defeated and
perished.</p>

<p>The death of Louis found Bohemia in a state of great disorder,
almost of anarchy. The two last kings had mainly resided in
Hungary, and in spite of the temporary agreement obtained at
the diet of St Wenceslas, the Bohemians had not succeeded in
establishing a strong indigenous government which might have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span>
taken the place of the absentee monarchs. Archduke Ferdinand
<span class="sidenote">Origin of the Habsburg dynasty.</span>
of Austria&mdash;afterwards the emperor Ferdinand I.&mdash;laid claim to
the Bohemian throne as husband of Anna, daughter
of King Vladislav. King Sigismund of Poland,
the dukes Louis and William of Bavaria, several
other German princes, as well as several Bohemian
noblemen, of whom Leo of Ro&#382;mital was the most important,
were also candidates. The diet resolved to entrust the election
to twenty-four of their members, chosen in equal number from
the three estates. These electors, on the 23rd of October (1526),
<span class="sidenote">Ferdinand.</span>
chose Ferdinand of Habsburg as their king. This date
is memorable, as it marks the permanent accession
of the Habsburg dynasty to the Bohemian throne, though
the Austrian archdukes Rudolph and Albert had previously been
rulers of Bohemia for short periods. Though Ferdinand fully
shared that devotion to Rome which is traditional in the
Habsburg dynasty, he showed great moderation in religious
matters, particularly at the beginning of his reign. His principal
object was to establish the hereditary right of his dynasty to the
Bohemian throne, and this object he pursued with characteristic
obstinacy. When a great fire broke out at Prague in 1541, which
destroyed all the state documents, Ferdinand obtained the
consent of the estates to the substitution of a charter stating
that he had been recognized as king in consequence of the
hereditary rights of his wife Anna, in the place of the former one,
which had stated that he had become king by election. This
caused great dissatisfaction and was one of the principal causes
of the troubles that broke out shortly afterwards. Ferdinand
had in 1531, mainly through the influence of his brother the
emperor Charles V., been elected king of the Romans and heir to
the Empire. He henceforth took a large part in the politics of
Germany, particularly after he had in 1547 concluded a treaty of
peace with Turkey, which assured the safety of the eastern
frontiers of his dominions. Charles V. about the same time
concluded his war with France, and the brothers determined to
adopt a firmer policy towards the Protestants of Germany, whose
power had recently greatly increased. The latter had, about the
time of the recognition of Ferdinand as king of the Romans, and
partly in consequence of that event, formed at Schmalkalden a
league, of which John Frederick, elector of Saxony, and Philip,
landgrave of Hesse, were the leaders. War broke out in Germany
in the summer of 1546, and Charles relied on the aid of his brother,
while the German Protestants on the other hand appealed to
their Bohemian co-religionists for aid.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the Reformation in Germany the views
of the Bohemian reformers had undergone a considerable change.
Some of the more advanced Utraquists differed but
little from the German Lutherans, while the Bohemian
<span class="sidenote">Struggles in the war against German Protestantism.</span>
Brethren, who at this moment greatly increased in
influence through the accession of several powerful
nobles, strongly sympathized with the Protestants of
Germany. Ferdinand&rsquo;s task of raising a Bohemian
army in support of his brother was therefore a difficult
one. He again employed his usual tortuous policy. He persuaded
the estates to vote a general levy of the forces of the
country under the somewhat disingenuous pretext that Bohemia
was menaced by the Turks; for at that period no armed force
could be raised in Bohemia without the consent of the estates of
the realm. Ferdinand fixed the town of Kaaden on the Saxon
frontier as the spot where the troops were to meet, but on his
arrival there he found that many cities and nobles&mdash;particularly
those who belonged to the community of the Bohemian Brethren&mdash;had
sent no men. Of the soldiers who arrived many were
Protestants who sympathized with their German co-religionists.
The Bohemian army refused to cross the Saxon frontier, and
towards the end of the year 1546 Ferdinand was obliged to disband
his Bohemian forces. Early in the following year he again called
on his Bohemian subjects to furnish an army in aid of his brother.
Only a few of the Romanists and more retrograde Utraquists
obeyed his order. The large majority of Bohemians, on the other
hand, considered the moment opportune for recovering the
ancient liberties of Bohemia, on which Ferdinand had encroached
in various ways by claiming hereditary right to the crown and by
curtailing the old privileges of the land. The estates met at
Prague in March 1547, without awaiting a royal summons,&mdash;undoubtedly
an unconstitutional proceeding. The assembly,
in which the influence of the representatives of the town of Prague
and of the knights and nobles who belonged to the Bohemian
Brotherhood was predominant, had a very revolutionary character.
This became yet more marked when the news of the
elector of Saxony&rsquo;s victory at Rochlitz reached Prague. The
estates demanded the re-establishment of the elective character
of the Bohemian kingdom, the recognition of religious liberty for
all, and various enactments limiting the royal prerogative. It
was decided to entrust the management of state affairs to a
committee of twelve members chosen in equal number from the
three estates. Of the members of the committee chosen by the
knights and nobles four belonged to the Bohemian Brotherhood.
The committee decided to equip an armed force, the command of
which was conferred on Kaspar Pflug of Rabenstein (d. 1576).
According to his instructions he was merely to march to the
Saxon frontier, and there await further orders from the estates;
there seems, however, little doubt that he was secretly instructed
to afford aid to the German Protestants. Pflug marched to
Joachimsthal on the frontier, but refused to enter Saxon territory
without a special command of the estates.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the great victory of the imperialists at Mühlberg
had for a time crushed German Protestantism. The Bohemians
were in a very difficult position. They had seriously offended
their sovereign and yet afforded no aid to the German Protestants.
The army of Pflug hastily dispersed, and the estates
still assembled at Prague endeavoured to propitiate Ferdinand.
They sent envoys to the camp of the king who, with his brother
Charles, was then besieging Wittenberg. Ferdinand received
the envoys better than they had perhaps expected. He indeed
always maintained his plan of making Bohemia a hereditary
kingdom under Habsburg rule, and of curtailing as far as possible
its ancient constitution, but he did not wish to drive to despair
a still warlike people. Ferdinand demanded that the Bohemians
should renounce all alliances with the German Protestants, and
declared that he would make his will known after his arrival
in Prague. He arrived there on the 20th of July, with a large
force of Spanish and Walloon mercenaries, and occupied the city
almost without resistance. Ferdinand treated the nobles and
knights with great forbearance, and contented himself with the
confiscation of the estates of some of those who had been most
compromised. On the other hand he dealt very severely with the
towns&mdash;Prague in particular. He declared that their ancient
privileges should be revised&mdash;a measure that practically signified
a broad confiscation of lands that belonged to the municipalities.
Ferdinand also forced the townsmen to accept the control of
state officials who were to be called town-judges and in Prague
town-captains. These royal representatives were given almost
unlimited control over municipal affairs. The Bohemian
Brethren were also severely persecuted, and their bishop Augusta
was imprisoned for many years.</p>

<p>Ferdinand&rsquo;s policy here was as able as it always was. The
peasantry had ceased to be dangerous since the establishment of
serfdom; the power of the cities was now thoroughly undermined.
Ferdinand had only to deal with the nobles and knights,
and he hoped that the influence of his court, and yet more that
of the Jesuits, whom he established in Bohemia about this time,
would gradually render them amenable to the royal will. If
we consider the customs of his time Ferdinand cannot be considered
as having acted with cruelty in the moment of his success.
Only four of the principal leaders of the revolt&mdash;two knights,
and two citizens of Prague&mdash;were sentenced to death. They
were decapitated on the square outside the Hrad&#265;any palace
where the estates met on that day (August 22). This diet
therefore became known as the &ldquo;Krvavy&rsquo;sne&#283;m&rdquo; (bloody diet).
In one of the last years of his life (1562) Ferdinand succeeded in
obtaining the coronation of his eldest son Maximilian as king of
Bohemia, thus ensuring to him the succession to the Bohemian
throne. As Ferdinand I. acceded to the Hungarian throne at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span>
the same time as to that of Bohemia, and as he also became king
of the Romans and after the death of Charles V. emperor, many
events of his life do not belong to the history of Bohemia. He
died in 1564.</p>

<p>Maximilian succeeded his father as king of Bohemia without
any opposition. Circumstances were greatly in his favour; he
had in his youth mainly been educated by Protestant
tutors, and for a time openly avowed strong sympathy
<span class="sidenote">Maximilian.</span>
for the party of church reform. This fact, which
became known in Bohemia, secured for him the support of the
Bohemian church reformers, while the Romanists and retrograde
Utraquists were traditionally on the side of the house of Habsburg.
The reign of Maximilian did not fulfil the hopes that met
it. Though he published new decrees against the Bohemian
Brethren, he generally refused to sanction any measures against
the Protestants, in spite of the advice of the Jesuits, who were
gradually obtaining great influence in Bohemia. He did nothing,
however, to satisfy the expectations of the partisans of church reform,
and indeed after a time began again to assist at the functions
of the Roman church, from which he had long absented himself.
Indifference, perhaps founded on religious scepticism, characterized
the king during the many ecclesiastical disputes that
played so large a part in his reign. In 1567 Maximilian, who had
also succeeded his father as king of Hungary and emperor,
visited the Bohemians for the first time since his accession to the
throne. Like most princes of the Habsburg dynasty, he was
constantly confronted at this period by the difficulty of raising
funds for warfare against the Turks. When he asked the
Bohemians to grant him supplies for this purpose, they immediately
<span class="sidenote">Abolition of the &ldquo;Compacts.&rdquo;</span>
retorted by bringing forward their demands with
regard to matters of religion. Their principal
demand appears somewhat strange in the light of the
events of the past. The estates expressed the wish that
the celebrated Compacts should cease to form part of the laws
of the country. These enactments had indeed granted freedom
of worship to the most moderate Utraquists&mdash;men who, except
that they claimed the right to receive the communion in both
kinds, hardly differed in their faith from the Roman church.
On the other hand Ferdinand I. had used the Compacts as an
instrument which justified him in oppressing the Bohemian
Brethren, and the advanced Utraquists, whose teaching now
differed but little from that of Luther. He had argued that all
those who professed doctrines differing from the Church of Rome
more widely than did the retrograde Utraquists, were outside
the pale of religious toleration. Maximilian, indifferent as usual
to matters of religious controversy, consented to the abolition
of the Compacts, and these enactments, which had once been
sacred to the Bohemian people, perished unregretted by all
parties. The Romanists had always hated them, believing them
not to be in accord with the general custom of the papal church,
while the Lutherans and Bohemian Brethren considered their
suppression a guarantee of their own liberty of worship.</p>

<p>In 1575 Maximilian, who had long been absent from Bohemia,
returned there, as the estates refused to grant subsidies to an
absentee monarch. The sittings of the diet that met in 1575 were
very prolonged. The king maintained a vacillating attitude,
influenced now by the threats of the Bohemians, now by the
advice of the papal nuncio, who had followed him to Prague.
The latter strongly represented to him how great would be the
difficulties that he would encounter in his other dominions,
should he make concessions to the Protestants of Bohemia.
The principal demand of the Bohemians was that the &ldquo;Confession
<span class="sidenote">Confessio Bohemica.</span>
of Augsburg&rdquo;&mdash;a summary of Luther&rsquo;s teaching&mdash;should
be recognized in Bohemia. They further
renewed the demand, which they had already expressed
at the diet of 1567, that the estates should have the right
of appointing the members of the consistory&mdash;the ecclesiastical
body which ruled the Utraquist church; for since the
death of John of Rokycan that church had had no archbishop.
After long deliberations and the king&rsquo;s final refusal to recognize
the confession of Augsburg, the majority of the diet, consisting
of members of the Bohemian brotherhood and advanced Utraquists,
drew up a profession of faith that became known as the
<i>Confessio Bohemica</i>. It was in most points identical with the
Augsburg confession, but differed from it with regard to the
doctrine of the sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. Here the
Bohemian profession agreed with the views of Calvin rather than
with those of Luther. This is undoubtedly due to the influence
of the Bohemian Brethren. The <i>Confessio Bohemica</i> was presented
to Maximilian, who verbally expressed his approval, but
would not consent to this being made public, and also refused
his consent to the inclusion of the <i>Confessio</i> among the charters
of the kingdom. Maximilian rejected the demand of the
Bohemian estates, that they and not the king should in future
appoint the members of the consistory. He finally, however,
consented to exempt the Lutherans and advanced Utraquists
from the jurisdiction of the consistory, and allowed them to
choose fifteen defenders&mdash;five of whom were to belong to each
of the estates&mdash;who were to have supreme control over the
Lutheran church. These defenders were to appoint for each
district a superintendent (moderator), who was to maintain order
and discipline among the clergy. As the Bohemian Brotherhood
had never recognized the consistory, that body now lost whatever
influence it had still possessed. It became, indeed, subservient
to the Romanist archbishopric of Prague, which had been re-established
by Ferdinand I. Its members henceforth were men
who on almost all points agreed with Rome, and sometimes even
men who had joined the Roman church, but continued by order
of their superiors to remain members of the consistory, where
it was thought that their influence might be useful to their new
creed.</p>

<p>The results of the diet of 1575 were on the whole favourable
to the estates, and they seem to have taken this view, for almost
immediately afterwards they recognized Maximilian&rsquo;s
eldest son Rudolph as his successor and consented to his
<span class="sidenote">Rudolph.</span>
being crowned king of Bohemia. Maximilian died in the following
year, and Rudolph succeeded him without any opposition.
The events of the last years of the reign of Rudolph have the
greatest importance for Bohemian history, but the earlier part
of his reign requires little notice. As Rudolph had been educated
in Spain it was at first thought that he would treat the Bohemian
church reformers with great severity. The new sovereign, however,
showed with regard to the unceasing religious controversy
the same apathy and indifference with which he also met matters
of state. He had been from his early youth subject to fits of
melancholia, and during several short periods was actually
insane. Rudolph was a great patron of the arts, and he greatly
contributed to the embellishment of Prague, which, as it was
his favourite residence, became the centre of the vast Habsburg
dominions. In 1600 the mental condition of Rudolph became so
seriously impaired that the princes of the house of Habsburg
thought it necessary to consider the future of the state, particularly
as Rudolph had no legitimate descendants. Matthias,
the eldest of his brothers, came to Prague and pointed out to
Rudolph the necessity of appointing a coadjutor, should he be
incapacitated from fulfilling his royal duties, and also of making
arrangements concerning the succession to the throne. These
suggestions were indignantly repelled by Rudolph, whose anger
was greatly increased by a letter of Pope Clement VIII. The
pope in a forcible though formally courteous manner pointed
out to him the evil results which his neglect of his royal duties
would entail on his subjects, and called on him to appoint one
of the Habsburg princes his successor both to the imperial
crown and to the thrones of Bohemia and Hungary. It is
probable that the fear that the pope might make good the
threats contained in this letter induced Rudolph, who had
hitherto been indifferent to matters of religion, to become
more subservient to the Roman church. The papal nuncio at
Prague, in particular, appears for a time to have obtained great
influence over the king. Under this influence, Rudolph in
1602 issued a decree which renewed obsolete enactments against
the Bohemian Brethren that had been published by King
Vladislav in 1508. The royal decree was purposely worded
in an obscure manner. It referred to the Compacts that had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>130</span>
been abolished, and was liable to an interpretation excluding
from tolerance all but the Romanists and the retrograde
Utraquists. It appeared therefore as a menace to the Lutherans&mdash;and
all the more advanced Utraquists had now embraced
that creed&mdash;as well as to the Bohemian Brethren. The estates
of Bohemia met at Prague in January 1603. The discussions
were very stormy. Budovec of Budova, a nobleman belonging
to the community of the Bohemian Brethren, became the leader
of all those who were opposed to the Church of Rome. He
vigorously attacked the royal decree, which he declared to be
contrary to the promises made by King Maximilian. He, however,
advised the estates to vote the supplies that King Rudolph
had demanded. Immediately after this vote had been passed,
the diet was closed by order of the king. Though the royal
power was at that period very weak in Bohemia, the open
partisanship of the king encouraged the Romanist nobles, who
were not numerous, but among whom were some owners of large
estates, to attempt to re-establish the Roman creed on their
territories. Some of these nobles committed great cruelties
while attempting to obtain these forcible conversions.</p>

<p>Strife again broke out between Rudolph and his treacherous
younger brother Matthias, who used the religious and political
controversies of the time for the purpose of supplanting his
brother. The formal cause of the rupture between the two
princes was Rudolph&rsquo;s refusal to sanction a treaty of peace with
Turkey, which Matthias had concluded as his brother&rsquo;s representative
in Hungary. The Hungarians accepted Matthias as
their ruler, and when his forces entered Moravia the estates of
that country had, by Charles, lord of &#381;erotin, also renounced
the allegiance of Rudolph. Matthias then invaded Bohemia,
and invited the estates of the kingdom to meet him at &#268;aslav
(Ceslau). In consequence of a sudden revolution of feeling for
which it is difficult to account, the Bohemians declined the
overtures of Matthias. The estates met at Prague in March
1608, and, though again submitting their demands concerning
ecclesiastical matters to Rudolph, authorized him to levy
troops for the defence of Bohemia. The forces of Matthias had
meanwhile entered Bohemia and had arrived at Libe&#328;, a small
town near Prague now incorporated with that city. Here
Matthias, probably disappointed by the refusal of the Bohemians
to join his standard, came to an understanding with his brother
(June 25, 1608). Rudolph formally ceded to Matthias the
government of Hungary, Moravia, and Upper and Lower
Austria, but retained his rights as king of Bohemia.</p>

<p>Soon after the conclusion of this temporary settlement, the
estates of Bohemia again brought their demands before their
king. Rudolph had declined to discuss all religious
matters during the time that the troops of his brother
<span class="sidenote">Diet of 1609. Demand for religious liberty.</span>
occupied part of Bohemia. The diet that met on the
20th of January 1609 is one of the most important
in the history of Bohemia. Here, as so frequently
in the 17th century, the religious controversies were
largely influenced by personal enmities. Rudolph never forgave
the treachery of his brother, and was secretly negotiating (at
the time when he again appeared as champion of Catholicism)
with Christian of Anhalt, the leader of the German Protestants.
This was known to the court of Spain, and the Bohemians also
knew that the king could therefore rely on no aid from that
quarter. They were therefore not intimidated when Rudolph,
vacillating as ever, suddenly assumed a most truculent attitude.
The estates had at their meeting in March of the previous
year drawn up a document consisting of twenty-five so-called
Articles, which formulated their demands with regard to matters
of religion. The king now demanded that this document,
which he considered illegal, should be delivered up to him for
destruction. The &ldquo;articles&rdquo; expressed the wish that the
<i>Confessio Bohemica</i> should be recognized as one of the fundamental
laws of the kingdom, and that complete religious liberty
should be granted to all classes. They further demanded that
the Protestants&mdash;as it now became customary to call jointly
the Utraquists, Lutherans and Bohemian Brethren&mdash;and the
Roman Catholics should have an equal right to hold all the
offices of state, and that the power of the Jesuits to acquire land
should be limited. They finally asked for redress of several
grievances caused by the misrule of Rudolph. This document
had remained in the hands of Budova, who refused to deliver
it to the king. The estates then chose twelve of their number&mdash;among
whom was Count Henry Matthias Thurn&mdash;who were to
negotiate with the king and his councillors. Protracted discussions
ensued, and the king finally stated, on the 31st of March,
that he could grant no concessions in matters of religion. On
the following day the estates met under the leadership of Budova.
They decided to arm for the defence of their rights, and when
the king immediately afterwards dissolved the diet, it was
resolved to meet again after a month, even without a royal
summons. When they returned to Prague, Adam of Sternberg,
the burgrave, again informed Budova that the king would grant
no concessions in ecclesiastical matters. Bohemia appeared
to be on the verge of a revolution. It is unnecessary to record
the frequent and contradictory resolutions of the king, influenced
now by the extreme Romanists, now by those of his councillors
who favoured a peaceful solution. Finally&mdash;on the 9th of July
1609&mdash;Rudolph signed the famed &ldquo;Letter of Majesty&rdquo; which
gave satisfaction to all the legitimate demands of the Bohemian
Protestants. In the &ldquo;Letter of Majesty&rdquo; Rudolph recognized
the <i>Confessio Bohemica</i>. He further granted to the Protestant
estates the control over the university of Prague, and authorized
them to elect the members of the Utraquist consistory. They
were further empowered to elect &ldquo;defenders&rdquo; chosen in equal
number from the estates of the nobles, knights and citizens,
who were to superintend the execution of the enactments of
the Letter of Majesty and generally to uphold the rights of the
Protestants. On the same day the Romanist and the Protestant
members of the diet also signed an agreement by which they
guaranteed to each other full liberty of religious worship and
declared that this liberty should be extended to all classes of
the population.</p>

<p>In 1611 the peace of Bohemia was again disturbed by the
invasion of the archduke Leopold of Austria, bishop of Passau,
who probably acted in connivance with his cousin
King Rudolph. Leopold succeeded in obtaining
<span class="sidenote">Matthias.</span>
possession of part of the town of Prague, but his army was
defeated by the troops which the Bohemian estates had hurriedly
raised, and he was obliged to leave Bohemia. Matthias considered
his hereditary rights menaced by the raid of Leopold
and again occupied Bohemia. Mainly at his instigation the
estates now formally deposed Rudolph, who survived his dethronement
only a few months, and died on the 20th of January
1612. Though Matthias had allied himself with the Bohemian
Protestants during his prolonged struggle against his brother,
he now adopted that policy favourable to the Church of Rome
which is traditional of the Habsburg dynasty. His relations
with the Bohemian Protestants, therefore, soon became strained.
In 1615 Matthias convoked a general diet, <i>i.e.</i> one that besides
the Bohemian representatives included also the representatives
of the &ldquo;lands of the Bohemian crown.&rdquo; At the meeting of this
diet the question of nationality, which through the constant
religious controversies had receded to the background, again
became predominant. Former enactments enforcing the use
of the national language were reaffirmed, and it was decreed that
Bohemian should be the &ldquo;authorized&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> official) language
of the country.</p>

<p>As Matthias was childless, the question as to the succession
to the Bohemian throne again arose. The king wished to secure
the succession to his cousin Ferdinand, duke of Styria.
Ferdinand was known as a fanatical adherent of the Church of
Rome and as a cruel persecutor of the Protestants of Styria.
None the less the state officials of Bohemia, by not very scrupulous
means, succeeded in persuading the estates to accept Ferdinand
as heir to the throne and to consent to his coronation, which
took place at Prague on the 17th of June 1617. No doubt
through the influence of Ferdinand, the policy of Matthias henceforth
assumed a yet more pronouncedly ultramontane character.
The king&rsquo;s councillors, all adherents of the Church of Rome,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>131</span>
openly expressed their hope that the Catholic Church would soon
recover its ancient hold over Bohemia. On the other hand the
Bohemian Protestants, led by Count Thurn, one of the few nobles
who had refused to vote for the recognition of Ferdinand as heir
to the throne, did not wish to defer what they considered an
inevitable conflict. It appeared to them more advantageous to
encounter the weak Matthias than his younger and more fanatical
successor. A comparatively unimportant incident precipitated
matters. In December 1617, the archbishop of Prague and the
abbot of B&#345;evnov (Braunau) ordered the suppression of the
Protestant religious services in churches that had been built on
their domains. This was a direct infringement of the agreement
concluded by the Romanist and Utraquist estates on the day on
which King Rudolph had signed the Letter of Majesty. The
defenders took immediate action, by inviting all Protestant
members of the diet to meet at Prague. They assembled there
on 21st of May 1618, and decided to proceed in full armour to
the Hrad&#265;any palace to bring their complaints to the knowledge
of the councillors of Matthias. On the following day, Thurn,
Wenceslas of Ruppa, Ulrich of Kinsky, and other members of
the more advanced party held a secret meeting, at which it was
decided to put to death the most influential of Matthias&rsquo;s
councillors. On the 23rd the representatives of the Protestants
of Bohemia proceeded to the Hrad&#265;any. Violent accusations
were brought forward, particularly against Martinic and Slavata,
the king&rsquo;s most trusted councillors, who were accused of having
advised him to oppose the wishes of the Bohemians. Finally
these two councillors, together with Fabricius, secretary of the
royal council, were thrown from the windows of the Hrad&#265;any
into the moat below&mdash;an event known in history as the Defenestration
of Prague. Both Martinic and Slavata were but
little injured, and succeeded in escaping from Prague. The
Bohemians immediately established a provisional government
consisting of thirty &ldquo;directors,&rdquo; ten of whom were chosen by
each of the estates. They also proceeded to raise an armed
force, the command of which was given to Count Thurn.
Hostilities with Austria began in July, when an imperial force
entered Bohemia. The troops of Matthias were, however, soon
repulsed by the Bohemians, and in November Thurn&rsquo;s army
entered Austria, but was soon obliged to retire to Bohemia
because of the lateness of the season.</p>

<p>In the following March the Bohemian crown became vacant
by the death of Matthias. On the 31st of July the Bohemian
estates pronounced the formal deposition of Ferdinand,
and on the 26th of August they elected as their king
<span class="sidenote">War with the emperor Ferdinand.</span>
Frederick, elector palatine. The new king and his
queen, Elizabeth of England, arrived in Bohemia in
October, and were crowned somewhat later at St Vitus&rsquo;s
cathedral in Prague. Warfare with Austria continued during
this year&mdash;1619. Thurn occupied Moravia, which now threw
in its lot with Bohemia, and he even advanced on Vienna, but
was soon obliged to retreat. In the following year events took
a fatal turn for Bohemia. The powerful duke Maximilian of
Bavaria joined his forces to those of Ferdinand, who had become
Matthias&rsquo;s successor as emperor, and who was determined to
reconquer Bohemia. Ferdinand also received aid from Spain,
Poland and several Italian states. Even the Lutheran elector of
Saxony espoused his cause. A large imperialist army, under
the command of the duke of Bavaria, Tilly and Bouquoi,
entered Bohemia in September 1620. After several skirmishes,
in all of which the Bohemians were defeated, the imperial forces
arrived at the outskirts of Prague on the evening of the 7th
of November. On the following morning they attacked the
Bohemian army, which occupied a slightly fortified position
on the plateau known as the &ldquo;Bila Hora&rdquo; (White Hill). The
Bohemians were defeated after a struggle of only a few hours,
and on the evening of battle the imperialists already occupied
the port of Prague, situated on the left bank of the Vltava
(Moldau). King Frederick, who had lost all courage, hurriedly
left Prague on the following morning.</p>

<p>Bohemia itself, as well as the lands of the Bohemian crown,
now submitted to Ferdinand almost without resistance. The
battle of the White Hill marks an epoch in the history of Bohemia.
The execution of the principal leaders of the national movement
<span class="sidenote">Submission of Bohemia.</span>
(June 21, 1621) was followed by a system
of wholesale confiscation of the lands of all who
had in any way participated in the national movement.
Almost the entire ancient nobility of Bohemia was
driven into exile, and adventurers from all countries, mostly
men who had served in the imperial army, shared the spoils.
Gradually all those who refused to recognize the creed of the
Roman church were expelled from Bohemia, and by the use of
terrible cruelty Catholicism was entirely re-established in the
country. In 1627 Ferdinand published a decree, which formally
suppressed the ancient free constitution of Bohemia, though a
semblance of representative government was left to the country.
The new constitution proclaimed the heredity of the Bohemian
crown in the house of Habsburg. It added a new &ldquo;estate,&rdquo;
that of the clergy, to the three already existing. This estate,
which was to take precedence of all the others, consisted of the
Roman archbishop of Prague and of all the ecclesiastics who were
endowed with landed estates. The diet was deprived of all
legislative power, which was exclusively vested in the sovereign.
At its meetings the diet was to discuss such matters only as were
laid before it by the representatives of the king. The estates
continued to have the right of voting taxes, but they were
specially forbidden to attach any conditions to the grants of
money which they made to their sovereign. It was finally decreed
that the German language should have equal right with the
Bohemian one in all the government offices and law-courts of
the kingdom. This had indeed become a necessity, since, in
consequence of the vast confiscations, the greatest part of the
land was in the hands of foreigners to whom the national
language was unknown. Though these enactments still left
some autonomy to Bohemia, the country gradually lost all
individuality. Its history from this moment to the beginning
of the 19th century is but a part of the history of Austria
(<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>Bohemia was the theatre of hostilities during a large part of
the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, which had begun in its capital. In 1631
the Saxons for a time occupied a large part of Bohemia,
and even attempted to re-establish Protestantism,
<span class="sidenote">Bohemia under Austrian domination.</span>
During the later period of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War
Bohemia was frequently pillaged by Swedish troops,
and the taking of part of Prague by the Swedish general
Königsmark in 1648 was the last event of the great war. The
attempts of the Swedish envoys to obtain a certain amount of
toleration for the Bohemian Protestants proved fruitless, as the
imperial representatives were inflexible on this point. At the
beginning of the 18th century the possibility of the extinction of
the male line of the house of Habsburg arose. The estates of
Bohemia, at a meeting that took place at Prague on the 16th of
October 1720, sanctioned the female succession to the Bohemian
throne and recognized the so-called Pragmatic Sanction which
proclaimed the indivisibility of the Habsburg realm. The
archduchess Maria Theresa, in whose favour these enactments
were made, none the less met with great opposition on the death
of her father the emperor Charles VI. Charles, elector of Bavaria,
raised claims to the Bohemian throne and invaded the country
with a large army of Bavarian, French and Saxon troops. He
occupied Prague, and a large part of the nobles and knights of
Bohemia took the oath of allegiance to him (December 19,
1741). The fortune of war, however, changed shortly afterwards.
Maria Theresa recovered Bohemia and the other lands that had
been under the rule of the house of Habsburg. During the reign of
Maria Theresa, and to a greater extent during that of her son
Joseph II., many changes in the internal administration of the
Habsburg realm took place which all tended to limit yet further
the autonomy of Bohemia. A decree of 1749 abolished the
separate law-courts that still existed in Bohemia, and a few years
later an Austro-Bohemian chancellor was appointed who was to
have the control of the administration of Bohemia, as well as of
the German domains of the house of Habsburg. The power of
the royal officials who constituted the executive government of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>132</span>
Bohemia was greatly curtailed, and though the chief representative
of the sovereign in Prague continued to bear the ancient
title of supreme burgrave, he was instructed to conform in all
matters to the orders of the central government of Vienna. Yet
more extreme measures tending to centralization were introduced
by the emperor Joseph, who refused to be crowned at Prague as
king of Bohemia. The powers of the Bohemian diet and of the
royal officials at Prague were yet further limited, and the German
language was introduced into all the upper schools of Bohemia.
Some of the reforms introduced by Joseph were, incidentally and
contrary to the wishes of their originator, favourable to the
Bohemian nationality. Thus the greater liberty which he granted
to the press enabled the Bohemians to publish a newspaper in
the national language. After the death of Joseph in 1790 the
Bohemian estates, whose meetings had been suspended during
his reign, again assembled, but they at first made but scanty
attempts to reassert their former rights. During the long
Napoleonic wars, in which the house of Habsburg was almost
continuously engaged, Bohemia continued in its previous lethargic
state. In 1804 a merely formal change in the constitutional
position of Bohemia took place when Francis I. assumed
the hereditary title of emperor of Austria. It was stated in an
imperial decree that the new title of the sovereign should in
no way prejudice the ancient rights of Bohemia and that the
sovereigns would continue to be crowned as kings of Bohemia.</p>

<p>After the re-establishment of European peace in 1815 the
long-suppressed national aspirations of Bohemia began to
revive. The national movement, however, at first only
found expression in the revival of Bohemian literature.
<span class="sidenote">Revival of national aspirations.</span>
The arbitrary and absolutist government of Prince
Metternich rendered all political action impossible in
the lands ruled by the house of Habsburg. In spite of this
pressure the estates of Bohemia began in 1845 to assume an
attitude of opposition to the government of Vienna. They
affirmed their right of voting the taxes of the country&mdash;a right
that was due to them according to the constitution of 1627. To
obtain the support of the wider classes of the population, they
determined in 1847 to propose at their session of the following
year that the towns should have a more extensive representation
at the diet, that the control of the estates over the finances of the
country should be made more stringent, and that the Bohemian
language should be introduced into all the higher schools of the
country. The revolutionary outbreak of 1848 prevented this
<span class="sidenote">Collapse in 1848.</span>
meeting of the estates. When the news of the February revolution
in Paris reached Prague the excitement there was very great.
On the 11th of March a vast public meeting voted a petition to
the government of Vienna which demanded that the Bohemian
language should enjoy equal rights with the German in all the
government offices of the country, that a general diet comprising
all the Bohemian lands, but elected on an extensive suffrage,
should be convoked, and that numerous liberal reforms should
be introduced. The deputation which presented these demands
in Vienna received a somewhat equivocal answer. In reply,
however, to a second deputation, the emperor Ferdinand declared
on the 8th of April that equality of rights would be secured to
both nationalities in Bohemia, that the question of the reunion of
Moravia and Silesia to Bohemia should be left to a general
meeting of representatives of all parts of Austria, and
that a new meeting of the estates of Bohemia, which
would include representatives of the principal towns,
would shortly be convoked. This assembly, which was to have
had full powers to create a new constitution, and which would
have established complete autonomy, never met, though the
election of its members took place on the 17th of May. In
consequence of the general national movement which is so
characteristic of the year 1848, it was decided to hold at Prague
a &ldquo;Slavic congress&rdquo; to which Slavs of all parts of the Austrian
empire, as well as those belonging to other countries, were
invited. The deliberations were interrupted by the serious riots
that broke out in the streets of Prague on the 12th of June.
They were suppressed after prolonged fighting and considerable
bloodshed. The Austrian commander, Prince Windischgrätz,
bombarded the city, which finally capitulated unconditionally.
The nationalist and liberal movement in Bohemia was thus
suddenly checked, though the Bohemians took part in the
Austrian constituent assembly that met at Vienna, and afterwards
at  Krom&#283;&#345;i&#382; (Kremsier).</p>

<p>By the end of the year 1849 all constitutional government had
ceased in Bohemia, as in all parts of the Habsburg empire. The
reaction that now ensued was felt more severely than in any
other part of the monarchy; for not only were all attempts to
obtain self-government and liberty ruthlessly suppressed, but
a determined attempt was made to exterminate the national
language. The German language was again exclusively used in
all schools and government offices, all Bohemian newspapers
were suppressed, and even the society of the Bohemian museum&mdash;a
society composed of Bohemian noblemen and scholars&mdash;was for
a time only allowed to hold its meetings under the supervision of
the police.</p>

<p>The events of the Italian campaign of 1859 rendered the
continuation of absolutism in the Austrian empire impossible.
It was attempted to establish a constitutional system
which, while maintaining to a certain extent the unity
<span class="sidenote">Austrian constitutional changes.</span>
of the empire, should yet recognize the ancient
constitutional rights of some of the countries united under
the rule of the house of Habsburg. A decree published on the
20th of October 1860 established diets with limited powers.
The composition of these parliamentary assemblies was to a
certain extent modelled on that of the ancient diets of Bohemia
and other parts of the empire. This decree was favourably
received in Bohemia, but the hopes which it raised in the country
fell when a new imperial decree appeared on the 26th of February
1861. This established a central parliament at Vienna with very
extensive powers, and introduced an electoral system which was
grossly partial to the Germans. The Bohemians indeed consented
to send their representatives to Vienna, but they left the
parliament in 1863, stating that the assembly had encroached on
the power which constitutionally belonged to the diet of Prague.
Two years later the central parliament of Vienna was suspended,
and in the following year&mdash;1866&mdash;the Austro-Prussian war caused
a complete change in the constitutional position of Bohemia.
The congress of Vienna in 1815 had declared that that country
should form part of the newly formed Germanic Confederation;
this was done without consulting the estates of the country, as
had been customary even after the battle of the White Hill on
the occasion of serious constitutional changes. The treaty with
Prussia, signed at Prague on the 23rd of August 1866, excluded
from Germany all lands ruled by the house of Habsburg. As a
natural consequence German influence declined in the Austrian
empire, and in Bohemia in particular. While Hungary now
obtained complete independence, the new constitution of 1867,
which applied only to the German and Slavic parts of the
Habsburg empire, maintained the system of centralization and
attempted to maintain the waning German influence. The
Bohemians energetically opposed this new constitution and
refused to send representatives to Vienna.</p>

<p>In 1871 it appeared probable for a moment that the wishes
of the Bohemians, who desired that their ancient constitution
should be re-established in a modernized form, would
be realized. The new Austrian prime minister, Count
<span class="sidenote">Renewed struggles of Bohemian nationalism.</span>
Karl Hohenwart, took office with the firm intention
of accomplishing an agreement between Bohemia and
the other parts of the Habsburg empire. Prolonged
negotiations ensued, and an attempt was made to
establish a constitutional system which, while satisfying the
claims of the Bohemians, would yet have firmly connected them
with the other lands ruled by the house of Habsburg. An
imperial message addressed to the diet of Prague (September 14,
1871) stated that the sovereign &ldquo;in consideration of the former
constitutional position of Bohemia and remembering the power
and glory which its crown had given to his ancestors, and the
constant fidelity of its population, gladly recognized the rights
of the kingdom of Bohemia, and was willing to confirm this
assurance by taking the coronation oath.&rdquo; Various influences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>133</span>
caused the failure of this attempt to reconcile Bohemia with
Austria. In 1872 a government with a pronounced German
tendency took office in Vienna, and the Bohemians for a time
again refused to attend the parliamentary assemblies of Vienna
and Prague. In 1879 Count Eduard Taaffe became Austrian prime
minister, and he succeeded in persuading the representatives
of Bohemia to take part in the deliberations of the
parliament of Vienna. They did so, after stating that they took
this step without prejudice to their view that Bohemia with
Moravia and Silesia constituted a separate state under the rule
of the same sovereign as Austria and Hungary. The government
of Count Taaffe, in recognition of this concession by the
Bohemians, consented to remove some of the grossest anomalies
connected with the electoral system of Bohemia, which had
hitherto been grossly partial to the German minority of the
population. The government of Count Taaffe also consented
to the foundation of a Bohemian university at Prague, which
greatly contributed to the intellectual development of the
country. On the fall of the government of Count Taaffe, Prince
Alfred Windischgrätz became prime minister. The policy of his
short-lived government was hostile to Bohemia and he was
soon replaced by Count Badeni.</p>

<p>Badeni again attempted to conciliate Bohemia. He did not
indeed consider it feasible to reopen the question of its
autonomy, but he endeavoured to remedy some of the most
serious grievances of the country. In the beginning
<span class="sidenote">The language question.</span>
of 1897 Count Badeni issued a decree which stated
that after a certain date all government officials who
wished to be employed in Bohemia would have to prove a certain
knowledge of the Bohemian as well as of the German language.
This decree met with violent opposition on the part of the
German inhabitants of Austria, and caused the fall of Count
Badeni&rsquo;s cabinet at the end of the year 1897. After a brief
interval he was succeeded by Count Thun and then by Count
Clary, whose government repealed the decrees that had to a
certain extent granted equal rights to the Bohemian language.
In consequence troubles broke out in Prague, and were severely
repressed by the Austrian authorities. During the subsequent
ministries of Körber and Gautsch the Bohemians continued
to oppose the central government of Vienna, and to assert their
national rights.</p>

Bohemian history from the beginning of the 15th century.</p>
</div>
<div class="author">(L.)</div>

<p class="pt2 center sc">Literature</p>

<p>The earliest records of the Bohemian or &#268;zech language are
very ancient, though the so-called MSS. of Zelena Hora (Grüneberg)
and Kralodvur (Königinhof) are almost certainly forgeries
of the early part of the 19th century. The earliest genuine
documents of the Bohemian language comprise several hymns
and legends; of the latter the legend of St Catherine and that
of St Dorothy have the greatest value. Several ancient epic
fragments have also been preserved, such as the <i>Alexandreis</i>
and <i>Tandarias a Floribella</i>. These and other early Bohemian
writings have been printed since the revival of Bohemian
literature in the 19th century. Of considerable historical value
is the rhymed chronicle generally though wrongly known as the
chronicle of Dalimil. The author, who probably lived during
the reign of King John (1310-1346), records the events of
Bohemian history from the earliest period to the reign of King
Henry of Carinthia, the immediate predecessor of John. A
strong feeling of racial antipathy to the Germans pervades the
chronicle.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly to be attributed to the high intellectual
level which Bohemia attained in the 14th century that at that
period we already find writers on religious and philosophical
subjects who used the national language.
<span class="sidenote">Old Czech literature.</span>
Of these the most important is Thomas of &#352;titný
(<i>c.</i> 1331-1401). Of his works, which contain many ideas similar
to those of his contemporary Wycliffe, those entitled
<i>O obecnych vecech Krestanskych</i> (on general Christian matters)
and <i>Besedni re&#269;i</i> (in a rough translation &ldquo;learned entertainments&rdquo;)
have most value. &#352;titný and some of his contemporaries
whose Bohemian writings have perished are known as the
forerunners of Huss. Huss, like many of his contemporaries
in Bohemia, wrote both in Bohemian and in Latin. Of
the Bohemian writings of Huss, who contributed greatly to the
development of his native language, the most important is his
<i>Výklad viry, desatera Boziho prikazani, a patere</i> (exposition
of the creed, the ten commandments and the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer) written
in 1412. Of his numerous other Bohemian works we may
mention the <i>Postilla</i> (collection of sermons), the treatises
<i>O poznani cesty prave k spaseni</i> (the true road to salvation)
and <i>O svatokupectvi</i> (on  simony), and a large collection of
letters; those written in prison are very touching.</p>

<p>The years that followed the death of Huss formed in Bohemia
a period of incessant theological strife. The anti-Roman or
Hussite movement was largely a democratic one, and it is therefore
natural that the national language rather than Latin should
have been used in the writings that belong to this period.
Unfortunately in consequence of the systematic destruction of all
Bohemian writings which took place through the agency of the
Jesuits, after the battle of the White Hill (1620), a large part
of this controversial literature has perished. Thus the writings
of the members of the extreme Hussite party, the so-called
Taborites, have been entirely destroyed. Of the writings of the
more moderate Hussites, known as the Calixtines or Utraquists,
some have been preserved. Such are the books entitled <i>Of
the Great Torment of the Holy Church</i> and the <i>Lives of the
Priests of Tabor</i>, written in a sense violently hostile to that
community. A Bohemian work by Archbishop John of Rokycan has also
been preserved; it is entitled <i>Postilla</i> and is similar though
inferior to the work of Huss that bears the same name.</p>

<p>A quite independent religious writer who belongs to the period
of the Hussite wars is Peter Chelcicky (born in the last years of
the 14th century, died 1460), who may be called the Tolstoy of
the 15th. His dominant ideas were horror of bloodshed and the
determination to accept unresistingly all, even unjust, decrees of
the worldly authorities. Though a strenuous enemy of the Church of
Rome, Chelcicky joined none of the Hussite parties. His masterpiece
is the <i>Sít viry</i> (the net of faith). Among his other works
his <i>Postilla</i> and polemical writings in the form of letters
to Archbishop John of Rokycan and Bishop Nicolas of Pelhrimov
deserve mention.</p>

<p>The Hussite period is rather poor in historical works written
in the language of the country. We should, however, mention
some chroniclers who were contemporaries and sometimes
eye-witnesses of the events of the Hussite wars. Their writings
have been collected and published by Frantisek Palacký under
the title of <i>Stare &#269;eske letopisy</i>.</p>

<p>In the 16th century when Bohemia was in a state of comparative
tranquillity, the native literature was largely developed.
Besides the writers of the community of the Bohemian Brethren,
we meet at this period with three historians of merit. Of these
far the best-known is Wenceslas Hajek of Libo&#269;an. The year
of his birth is uncertain, but we read of him as a priest in 1524;
he died in 1553. His great work <i>Kronika &#269;eska</i> was dedicated
to the emperor Ferdinand I., king of Bohemia, and appeared
under the auspices of government officials. It has therefore a
strong dynastic and Romanist tendency, and its circulation was
permitted even at the time when most Bohemian books were
prohibited and many totally destroyed. Hajek&rsquo;s book was
translated into several languages and frequently quoted. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>134</span>
find such second-hand quotations even in the works of many
writers who had probably never heard of Hajek. His book is,
however, inaccurate and grossly partial. Very little known on
the other hand are the works of Barto&#353;, surnamed &ldquo;pisár&rdquo;
(the writer), as he was for many years employed as secretary by
the city of Prague, and those of Sixt of Ottersdorf. The work
of Barto&#353; (or Bartholomew) entitled the <i>Chronicle of Prague</i> has
great historical value. He describes the troubles that befell
Prague and Bohemia generally during the reign of the weak
and absentee sovereign King Louis. The year of the birth of
Bartos is uncertain, but it is known that he died in 1539. The
somewhat later work of Sixt of Ottersdorf (1500-1583) deals with
a short but very important episode in the history of Bohemia.
It is entitled <i>Memorials of the Troubled Years 1546 and 1547</i>.
The book describes the unsuccessful rising of the Bohemians
against Ferdinand I. of Austria. Sixt took a considerable part
in this movement, a fact that greatly enhances the value of his
book.</p>

<p>Though the life of Chel&#265;icky, who has already been mentioned,
was an isolated one, he is undoubtedly the indirect founder of
the community of the &ldquo;Bohemian Brethren,&rdquo; who greatly
influenced Bohemian literature. Almost all their historical and
theological works were written in the national language, which
through their influence became far more refined and polished.
Before referring to some of the writings of members of the
community we should mention the famed translation of the Scriptures
known as the <i>Bible of Kralice</i>. It was the joint work
of several divines of the brotherhood, and was first printed at
Kralice in Moravia in 1593. Brother Gregory, surnamed the
patriarch of the brotherhood, has left a large number of writings
dealing mainly with theological matters. Most important are the
<i>Letters to Archbishop Rokycan</i> and the book <i>On good and evil
priests</i>. After the death of Brother Gregory in 1480 discord
broke out in the community, and it resulted in very great literary
activity. Brothers Lucas, Blahoslav and Jaffet, as well as
Augusta, a bishop of the community, have left us numerous
controversial works. Very interesting is the account of the
captivity of Bishop Augusta, written by his companion the young
priest Jan Bilek. We have evidence that numerous historical
works written by members of the brotherhood existed, but
most of them perished in the 17th century when nearly all
anti-Roman books written in Bohemia were destroyed. Thus
only fragments of Blahoslav&rsquo;s <i>History of the Unity</i> (<i>i.e.</i>
the brotherhood) have been preserved. One of the historians of
the brotherhood, Wenceslas Brezan, wrote a <i>History of the
House of Rosenberg</i>, of which only the biographies of William
and Peter of Rosenberg have been preserved. The greatest writer
of the brotherhood is John Amos Komensky or Comenius (1592-1670).
Of his many works written in his native language the most important
is his <i>Labyrinth of the World</i>, an allegorical tale
which is perhaps the most famous work written in Bohemian.<a name="fa4a" id="fa4a" href="#ft4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
Many of the numerous devotional and educational writings of
Comenius,&mdash;his works number 142,&mdash;are also written in his
native tongue.</p>

<p>The year 1620, which witnessed the downfall of Bohemian
independence, also marks the beginning of a period of decline
of the national tongue, which indeed later, in the 18th century,
was almost extinct as a written language. Yet we must notice
besides Comenius two other writers, both historians, whose
works belong to a date later than 1620. Of these one was an
adherent of the nationalist, the other of the imperialist party.
Paul Skála ze Zho&#345;e (1582-c. 1640) was an official in the service
of the &ldquo;winter king&rdquo; Frederick of the Palatinate. He for a
time followed his sovereign into exile, and spent the last years of
his life at Freiberg in Saxony. It was at this period of his life,
after his political activity had ceased, that he wrote his historical
works. His first work was a short book which is a mere series
of chronological tables. Somewhat later he undertook a vast work
entitled <i>Histoire cirkevni</i> (history of the church). In spite
of its title the book, which consists of ten enormous MS. volumes,
deals as much with political as with ecclesiastical matters. The
most valuable part, that dealing with events of 1602 to 1623, of
which Skála writes as a contemporary and often as an eye-witness,
has been edited and published by Prof. Tieftrunk. A contemporary
and a political opponent of Skála was William Count
Slavata (1572-1652). He was a faithful servant of the house of
Habsburg, and one of the government officials who were thrown
from the windows of the Hrad&#265;any palace in 1618, at the beginning
of the Bohemian uprising. In 1637 Slavata published his
<i>Pamety</i> (memoirs) which deal exclusively with the events of
the years 1618 and 1619, in which he had played so great a part.
During the leisure of the last years of his long life Slavata
composed a vast work entitled <i>Historické Spisovani</i> (historical
works). It consists of fourteen large MS. volumes, two of which
contain the previously-written memoirs. These two volumes
have recently been edited and published by Dr Jos. Jir&#283;cek.</p>

<p>After the deaths of Skála, Slavata and Comenius, no works
of any importance were written in the Bohemian language for
a considerable period, and the new Austrian government
endeavoured in every way to discourage the
<span class="sidenote">19th-century revival.</span>
use of that language. A change took place when the
romantic movement started at the beginning of the
19th century. The early revival of the Bohemian language was
very modest, and at first almost exclusively translations from
foreign languages were published. The first writer who again
drew attention to the then almost forgotten Bohemian language
was Joseph Dobrovský (1753-1829). His works, which include
a grammar of the Bohemian language and a history of Bohemian
literature, were mostly written in German or Latin, and his only
Bohemian works are some essays which he contributed to the
early numbers of the <i>&#268;asopis Musea Království C&#268;eského</i>
(Journal of the Bohemian Museum) and a collection of letters.</p>

<p>It is, however, to four men belonging to a time somewhat
subsequent to that of Dobrovský that the revival of the language
and literature of Bohemia is mainly due. They are Jungmann,
Kolar, &#352;afa&#345;ik and Palacký. Joseph Jungmann (1773-1847)
published early in life numerous Bohemian translations of
German and English writers. His most important works are his
<i>Dejepes literatury &#269;eska</i> (history of Bohemian literature),
and his monumental German and Bohemian dictionary, which largely
contributed to the development of the Bohemian language.
John Kolar (1793-1852) was the greatest poet of the Bohemian
revival, and it is only in quite recent days that Bohemian poetry
has risen to a higher level. Kolar&rsquo;s principal poem is the <i>Slavy
dcera</i> (daughter of Slavia), a personification of the Slavic race.
Its principal importance at the present time consists rather in
the part it played in the revival of Bohemian literature than in
its artistic value. Kolar&rsquo;s other works are mostly philological
studies. Paul Joseph &#352;afa&#345;ik (1795-1861) was a very fruitful
writer. His <i>Staro&#382;itnosti Slovanské</i> (Slavic antiquities), an
attempt to record the then almost unknown history and literature
of the early Slavs, has still considerable value. Francis Palacký
(1798-1876) is undoubtedly the greatest of Bohemian historians.
Among his many works his history of Bohemia from the earliest
period to the year 1526 is the most important.</p>

<p>Other Bohemian writers whose work belongs mainly to the
earlier part of the 19th century are the poets Francis Ladislav
&#268;elakovský, author of the <i>R&#367;&#382;e stolistova</i> (the hundred-leaved
rose), Erben, Macha, Tyl, to mention but a few of the most
famous writers. The talented writer Karel Havlicek, the
founder of Bohemian journalism, deserves special notice.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the 19th century, and particularly
after the foundation of the national university in 1882, Bohemian
literature has developed to an extent that few perhaps foresaw.
Of older writers Bo&#382;ena N&#283;mceva, whose <i>Babi&#269;ka</i> has been
translated into many languages, and Benes Trebizky, author
of many historical novels, should be named. John Neruda
(1834-1891) was a very fruitful and talented writer both of
poetry and of prose. Perhaps the most valuable of his many
works is his philosophical epic entitled <i>Kosmicke basne</i> (cosmic
poems). Julius Zeyer (1841-1901) also wrote much both in
prose and in verse. His epic poem entitled <i>Vysehrad</i>, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>135</span>
celebrates the ancient glory of the acropolis of Prague, has great
value, and of his many novels <i>Jan Maria Plojhar</i> has had the
greatest success. Of later Bohemian poets the best are Adolf
Heyduk, Svatopluk &#268;ech and Jaroslav Vrchlický (b. 1853).
Of Svatopluk Cech&rsquo;s many poems, which are all inspired by
national enthusiasm, <i>Václav z Michalovic, Lesetinsky Kovar</i>
(the smith of Lesetin) and <i>Basne otroka</i> (the songs of a slave)
are the most notable. While Vrchlický (pseudonym of Emil
Frida) has no less strong patriotic feelings, he has been more
catholic in the choice of the subjects of his many works, both in
poetry and in prose. Of his many collections of lyric poems
<i>Rok na jihu</i> (a year in the south), <i>Poute k Eldoradu</i> (pilgrimages
to Eldorado) and <i>Sonety Samotare</i> (sonnets of a recluse) have
particular value. Vrchlický is also a very brilliant dramatist.
Bohemian novelists have become very numerous. Mention
should be made of Alois Jirásek, also a distinguished dramatic
author; Jacob Arbes, whose <i>Romanetta</i> have great merit; and
Václav Hladík, whose <i>Evzen Voldan</i> is a very striking representation
of the life of modern Prague. Like so many Bohemian
authors, Hladík also is a copious dramatic author.</p>

<p>Bohemia has been very fruitful in historic writers. Wenceslas
Tomek (1818-1905) left many historical works, of which his
<i>D&#283;jepis mi&#283;sta Prahy</i> (history of the town of Prague) is the
most important. Jaroslav Goll (b. 1846) is the author of many
historical works, especially on the community of the Bohemian
Brethren. Professor Joseph Kalousek has written much on the
early history of Bohemia, and is also the author of a very valuable
study of the ancient constitution (<i>Statni pravo</i>) of Bohemia.
Dr Anton Rezek is the author of important historical studies,
many of which appeared in the Journal of the Bohemian Museum
and in the <i>&#268;esky &#268;asopis Historický</i> (Bohemian Historical
Review), which he founded in 1895 jointly with Professor Jaroslav
Goll. More recently Dr Václav Flajshans has published some
excellent studies on the life and writings of John Huss, and
Professors Pic and Niederle have published learned archaeological
studies on the earliest period of Bohemian history.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOHEMUND,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> the name of a series of princes of Antioch,
afterwards counts of Tripoli. Their connexion is shown in the
following table:&mdash;</p>

<div class="ptb1"><img style="width:760px; height:341px" src="images/img135.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="sc">Bohemund I.</span> (<i>c</i>. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1058-1111), prince of Otranto and
afterwards of Antioch, whose first name was Marc, was the
eldest son of Robert Guiscard, <i>dux Apuliae et Calabriae</i>, by an
early marriage contracted before 1059. He served under his
father in the great attack on the East Roman empire (1080-1085),
and commanded the Normans during Guiscard&rsquo;s absence
(1082-1084), penetrating into Thessaly as far as Larissa, but
being repulsed by Alexius Comnenus. This early hostility to
Alexius had a great influence in determining the course of his
future career, and thereby helped to determine the history of
the First Crusade, of which Bohemund may be regarded as the
leader. On the death of Guiscard in 1085, his younger son
Roger, born &ldquo;in the purple&rdquo; of a Lombard princess Sicelgaeta,
succeeded to the duchy of Apulia and Calabria, and a war arose
between Bohemund (whom his father had destined for the
throne of Constantinople) and Duke Roger. The war was finally
composed by the mediation of Urban II. and the award of
Otranto and other possessions to Bohemund. In 1096 Bohemund,
along with his uncle the great count of Sicily, was attacking
Amalfi, which had revolted against Duke Roger, when bands of
crusaders began to pass, on their way through Italy to Constantinople.
The zeal of the crusader came upon Bohemund: it is
possible, too, that he saw in the First Crusade a chance of
realizing his father&rsquo;s policy (which was also an old Norse instinct)
of the <i>Drang nach Osten</i>, and hoped from the first to carve for
himself an eastern principality. He gathered a fine Norman
army (perhaps the finest division in the crusading host), at the
head of which he crossed the Adriatic, and penetrated to Constantinople
along the route he had tried to follow in 1082-1084.
He was careful to observe a &ldquo;correct&rdquo; attitude towards
Alexius, and when he arrived at Constantinople in April 1097 he
did homage to the emperor. He may have negotiated with
Alexius about a principality at Antioch; if he did so, he
had little encouragement. From Constantinople to Antioch
Bohemund was the real leader of the First Crusade; and it says
much for his leading that the First Crusade succeeded in crossing
Asia Minor, which the Crusades of 1101, 1147 and 1189 failed to
accomplish. A <i>politique</i>, Bohemund was resolved to engineer
the enthusiasm of the crusaders to his own ends; and when his
nephew Tancred left the main army at Heraclea, and attempted
to establish a footing in Cilicia, the movement may have been
already intended as a preparation for Bohemund&rsquo;s eastern
principality. Bohemund was the first to get into position
before Antioch (October 1097), and he took a great part in the
siege, beating off the Mahommedan attempts at relief from the
east, and connecting the besiegers on the west with the port
of St Simeon and the Italian ships which lay there. The capture
of Antioch was due to his connexion with Firuz, one of the
commanders in the city; but he would not bring matters to an
issue until the possession of the city was assured him (May 1098),
under the terror of the approach of Kerbogha with a great army
of relief, and with a reservation in favour of Alexius, if Alexius
should fulfil his promise to aid the crusaders. But Bohemund
was not secure in the possession of Antioch, even after its
surrender and the defeat of Kerbogha;
he had to make good his
claims against Raymund of Toulouse,
who championed the rights of
Alexius. He obtained full possession
in January 1099, and stayed in the
neighbourhood of Antioch to secure
his position, while the other crusaders
moved southward to the capture of
Jerusalem. He came to Jerusalem
at Christmas 1099, and had Dagobert
of Pisa elected as patriarch,
perhaps in order to check the growth
of a strong Lotharingian power in
the city. It might seem in 1100
that Bohemund was destined to
found a great principality in Antioch,
which would dwarf Jerusalem; he
had a fine territory, a good strategical position and a strong
army. But he had to face two great forces&mdash;the East Roman
empire, which claimed the whole of his territories and was
supported in its claim by Raymund of Toulouse, and the strong
Mahommedan principalities in the north-east of Syria. Against
these two forces he failed. In 1100 he was captured by Danishmend
of Sivas, and he languished in prison till 1103. Tancred
took his place; but meanwhile Raymund established himself
with the aid of Alexius in Tripoli, and was able to check the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span>
expansion of Antioch to the south. Ransomed in 1103 by the
generosity of an Armenian prince, Bohemund made it his first
object to attack the neighbouring Mahommedan powers in
order to gain supplies. But in heading an attack on Harran,
in 1104, he was severely defeated at Balich, near Rakka on the
Euphrates. The defeat was decisive; it made impossible the
great eastern principality which Bohemund had contemplated.
It was followed by a Greek attack on Cilicia; and despairing of
his own resources, Bohemund returned to Europe for reinforcements
in order to defend his position. His attractive personality
won him the hand of Constance, the daughter of the French king,
Philip I., and he collected a large army. Dazzled by his success,
he resolved to use his army not to defend Antioch against the
Greeks, but to attack Alexius. He did so; but Alexius, aided
by the Venetians, proved too strong, and Bohemund had to
submit to a humiliating peace (1108), by which he became the
vassal of Alexius, consented to receive his pay, with the title of
<i>Sebastos</i>, and promised to cede disputed territories and to admit
a Greek patriarch into Antioch. Henceforth Bohemund was a
broken man. He died without returning to the East, and was
buried at Canossa in Apulia, in 1111.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Literature</span>.&mdash;The anonymous <i>Gesta Francorum</i> (edited by H.
Hagenmeyer) is written by one of Bohemund&rsquo;s followers; and the
<i>Alexiad</i> of Anna Comnena is a primary authority for the whole of
his life. His career is discussed by B. von Kügler, <i>Bohemund und
Tancred</i> (Tübingen, 1862); while L. von Heinemann, <i>Geschichte der
Normannen in Sicilien und Unteritalien</i> (Leipzig, 1894), and R.
Röhricht, <i>Geschichte des ersten Kreuzzuges</i> (Innsbruck, 1901), and
<i>Geschichte des Königreichs Jerusalem</i> (Innsbruck, 1898), may also be
consulted for his history.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">Bohemund II.</span> (1108-1131), son of the great Bohemund by his
marriage with Constance of France, was born in 1108, the year of
his father&rsquo;s defeat at Durazzo. In 1126 he came from Apulia to
Antioch (which, since the fall of Roger, the successor of Tancred,
in 1119, had been under the regency of Baldwin II.); and in 1127
he married Alice, the younger daughter of Baldwin. After some
trouble with Joscelin of Edessa, and after joining with Baldwin II.
in an attack on Damascus (1127), he was defeated and slain on
his northern frontier by a Mahommedan army from Aleppo
(1131). He had shown that he had his father&rsquo;s courage: if time
had sufficed, he might have shown that he had the other qualities
of the first Bohemund.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bohemund III.</span> was the son of Constance, daughter of
Bohemund II., by her first husband, Raymund of Antioch. He
succeeded his mother in the principality of Antioch in 1163, and
first appears prominently in 1164, as regent of the kingdom of
Jerusalem during the expedition of Amalric I. to Egypt. During
the absence of Amalric, he was defeated and captured by
Nureddin (August 1164) at Harenc, to the east of Antioch. He
was at once ransomed by his brother-in-law, the emperor Manuel,
and went to Constantinople, whence he returned with a Greek
patriarch. In 1180 he deserted his second wife, the princess
Orguilleuse, for a certain Sibylla, and he was in consequence
excommunicated. By Orguilleuse he had had two sons, Raymund
and Bohemund (the future Bohemund IV.), whose relations
and actions determined the rest of his life. Raymund married
Alice, a daughter of the Armenian prince Rhupen (Rupin), brother
of Leo of Armenia, and died in 1197, leaving behind him a son,
Raymund Rhupen. Bohemund, the younger brother of Raymund,
had succeeded the last count of Tripoli in the possession
of that county, 1187; and the problem which occupied the last
years of Bohemund III. was to determine whether his grandson,
Raymund Rhupen, or his younger son, Bohemund, should succeed
him in Antioch. Leo of Armenia was naturally the champion of
his great-nephew, Raymund Rhupen; indeed he had already
claimed Antioch in his own right, before the marriage of his niece
to Raymund, in 1194, when he had captured Bohemund III. at
Gastin, and attempted without success to force him to cede
Antioch.<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Bohemund the younger, however, prosecuted his
claim with vigour, and even evicted his father from Antioch
about 1199: but he was ousted by Leo (now king of Armenia by
the grace of the emperor, Henry VI.), and Bohemund III. died
in possession of his principality (1201).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bohemund IV.</span>, younger son of Bohemund III. by his second
wife Orguilleuse, became count of Tripoli in 1187, and succeeded
his father in the principality of Antioch, to the exclusion of
Raymund Rhupen, in 1201. But the dispute lasted for many
years (Leo of Armenia continuing to champion the cause of his
great-nephew), and long occupied the attention of Innocent III.
Bohemund IV. enjoyed the support of the Templars (who, like
the Knights of St John, had estates in Tripoli) and of the Greek
inhabitants of Antioch, to whom he granted their own patriarch
in 1207, while Leo appealed (1210-1211) both to Innocent III.
and the emperor Otto IV., and was supported by the Hospitallers.
In 1216 Leo captured Antioch, and established Raymund Rhupen
as its prince; but he lost it again in less than four years, and it
was once more in the possession of Bohemund IV. when Leo died
in 1220. Raymund Rhupen died in 1221; and after the event
Bohemund reigned in Antioch and Tripoli till his death, proving
himself a determined enemy of the Hospitallers, and thereby
incurring excommunication in 1230. He first joined, and then
deserted, the emperor Frederick II., during the crusade of
1228-29; and he was excluded from the operation of the
treaty of 1229. When he died in 1233, he had just concluded
peace with the Hospitallers, and Gregory IX. had released him
from the excommunication of 1230.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bohemund V.</span>, son of Bohemund IV. by his wife Plaisance
(daughter of Hugh of Gibelet), succeeded his father in 1233. He
was prince of Antioch and count of Tripoli, like his father; and
like him he enjoyed the alliance of the Templars and experienced
the hostility of Armenia, which was not appeased till 1251, when
the mediation of St Louis, and the marriage of the future
Bohemund VI. to the sister of the Armenian king, finally brought
peace. By his first marriage in 1225 with Alice, the widow of
Hugh I. of Cyprus, Bohemund V. connected the history of
Antioch for a time with that of Cyprus. He died in 1251. He
had resided chiefly at Tripoli, and under him Antioch was left to
be governed by its bailiff and commune.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bohemund VI.</span> was the son of Bohemund V. by Luciana, a
daughter of the count of Segni, nephew of Innocent III. Born
in 1237, Bohemund VI. succeeded his father in 1251, and was
knighted by St Louis in 1252. His sister Plaisance had married
in 1250 Henry I. of Cyprus, the son of Hugh I.; and the Cypriot
connexion of Antioch, originally formed by the marriage of Bohemund
V. and Alice, the widow of Hugh I., was thus maintained.
In 1252 Bohemund VI. established himself in Antioch, leaving
Tripoli to itself, and in 1257 he procured the recognition of his
nephew, Hugh II., the son of Henry I. by Plaisance, as king of
Jerusalem. He allied himself to the Mongols against the advance
of the Egyptian sultan; but in 1268 he lost Antioch to
Bibars, and when he died in 1275 he was only count of Tripoli.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bohemund VII.</span>, son of Bohemund VI. by Sibylla, sister
of Leo III. of Armenia, succeeded to the county of Tripoli in
1275, with his mother as regent. In his short and troubled reign
he had trouble with the Templars who were established in
Tripoli; and in the very year of his death (1287) he lost Laodicea
to the sultan of Egypt. He died without issue; and as, within
two years of his death, Tripoli was captured, the county of
Tripoli may be said to have become extinct with him.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Literature</span>.&mdash;The history of the Bohemunds is the history of
the principality of Antioch, and, after Bohemund IV., of the county
of Tripoli also. For Antioch, we possess its <i>Assises</i> (Venice, 1876);

<p><span class="bold">BÖHMER, JOHANN FRIEDRICH<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> (1795-1863), German
historian, son of Karl Ludwig Böhmer (d. 1817), was born at
Frankfort-on-Main on the 22nd of April 1795. Educated at
the universities of Heidelberg and Göttingen, he showed an
interest in art and visited Italy; but returning to Frankfort
he turned his attention to the study of history, and became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>137</span>
secretary of the <i>Gesellschaft für ältere deutsche Geschichtskunde</i>.
He was also archivist and then librarian of the city of Frankfort.
Böhmer had a great dislike of Prussia and the Protestant faith,
and a corresponding affection for Austria and the Roman
Catholic Church, to which, however, he did not belong. His
critical sense was, perhaps, somewhat warped; but his researches
are of great value to students. He died unmarried, at Frankfort,
on the 22nd of October 1863. Böhmer&rsquo;s historical work was
chiefly concerned with collecting and tabulating charters and
other imperial documents of the middle ages. First appeared
an abstract, the <i>Regesta chronologico-diplomatica regum atque
imperatorum Romanorum 911-1313</i> (Frankfort, 1831), which was
followed by the <i>Regesta chronologico-diplomatica Karolorum.
Die Urkunden sämtlicher Karolinger in kurzen Auszügen</i> (Frankfort,
1833), and a series of <i>Regesta imperii</i>. For the period
1314-1347 (Frankfort, 1839) the <i>Regesta</i> was followed by three,
and for the period 1246-1313 (Frankfort, 1844) by two supplementary
volumes. The remaining period of the <i>Regesta</i>, as edited
by Böhmer, is 1198-1254 (Stuttgart, 1849). These collections
contain introductions and explanatory passages by the author.
Very valuable also is the <i>Fontes rerum Germanicarum</i> (Stuttgart,
1843-1868), a collection of original authorities for German history
during the 13th and 14th centuries. The fourth and last volume
of this work was edited by A. Huber after the author&rsquo;s death.
Other collections edited by Böhmer are: <i>Die Reichsgesetze
900-1400</i> (Frankfort, 1832); <i>Wittelsbachische Regesten von der
Erwerbung des Herzogtums Bayern bis zu 1340</i> (Stuttgart, 1854);
and <i>Codex diplomaticus Moeno-Francofurtanus. Urkundenbuch
der Reichsstadt Frankfurt</i> (Frankfort, 1836; new edition by F.
Law, 1901). Other volumes and editions of the <i>Regesta imperii</i>,
edited by J. Ficker, E. Mühlbacher, E. Winkelmann and others,
are largely based on Böhmer&rsquo;s work. Böhmer left a great amount
of unpublished material, and after his death two other works
were published from his papers: <i>Acta imperii selecta</i>, edited by
J. Ficker (Innsbruck, 1870); and <i>Regesta archiepiscoporum
Maguntinensium</i>, edited by C. Will (Innsbruck, 1877-1886).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOHN, HENRY GEORGE<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> (1796-1884), British publisher,
son of a German bookbinder settled in England, was born in
London on the 4th of January 1796. In 1831 he started as a
dealer in rare books and &ldquo;remainders.&rdquo; In 1841 he issued his
&ldquo;Guinea&rdquo; Catalogue of books, a monumental work containing
23,208 items. Bohn was noted for his book auction sales: one
held in 1848 lasted four days, the catalogue comprising twenty
folio pages. Printed on this catalogue was the information:
&ldquo;Dinner at 2 o&rsquo;clock, dessert at 4, tea at 5, and supper at 10.&rdquo;
The name of Bohn is principally remembered by the important
<i>Libraries</i> which he inaugurated: these were begun in 1846 and
comprised editions of standard works and translations, dealing
with history, science, classics, theology and archaeology, consisting
in all of 766 volumes. One of Bohn&rsquo;s most useful and
laborious undertakings was his revision (6 vols. 1864) of <i>The
Bibliographer&rsquo;s Manual of English Literature</i> (1834) of W.T.
Lowndes. The plan includes bibliographical and critical notices,
particulars of prices, &amp;c., and a considerable addition to the
original work. It had been one of Bohn&rsquo;s ambitions to found
a great publishing house, but, finding that his sons had no taste
for the trade, he sold the <i>Libraries</i> in 1864 to Messrs. Bell and
Daldy, afterwards G. Bell &amp; Sons. Bohn was a man of wide
culture and many interests. He himself made considerable
contributions to his <i>Libraries</i>: he collected pictures, china and
ivories, and was a famous rose-grower. He died at Twickenham
on the 22nd of August 1884.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BÖHTLINGK, OTTO VON<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> (1815-1004) German Sanskrit
scholar, was born on the 30th of May (11th of June O.S.) 1815
at St Petersburg. Having studied (1833-1835) Oriental languages,
particularly Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit, at the university of
St Petersburg, he continued his studies in Germany, first in
Berlin and then (1839-1842) in Bonn. Returning to St Petersburg
in 1842, he was attached to the Royal Academy of Sciences,
and was elected an ordinary member of that society in 1855.
In 1860 he was made &ldquo;Russian state councillor,&rdquo; and later
&ldquo;privy councillor&rdquo; with a title of nobility. In 1868 he settled
at Jena, and in 1885 removed to Leipzig, where he resided until
his death there on the 1st of April 1904. Böhtlingk was one of
the most distinguished scholars of the 19th century, and his
works are of pre-eminent value in the field of Indian and comparative
philology. His first great work was an edition of
Panini&rsquo;s <i>Acht Bücher grammatischer Regeln</i> (Bonn, 1839-1840),
which was in reality a criticism of Franz Bopp&rsquo;s philological
methods. This book Böhtlingk again took up forty-seven years
later, when he republished it with a complete translation under
the title <i>Paninis Grammatik mit Übersetzung</i> (Leipzig, 1887). The
earlier edition was followed by <i>Vopadevas Grammatik</i> (St Petersburg,
1847); <i>Über die Sprache der Jakuten</i> (St Petersburg, 1851);
<i>Indische Spruche</i> (2nd ed. in 3 parts, St Petersburg, 1870-1873, to
which an index was published by Blau, Leipzig, 1893); a critical examination
and translation of <i>Chhandogya-upanishad (St Petersburg,
1889) and a translation of Brihadaranyaka-upanishad</i> (St
Petersburg, 1889). In addition to these he published several
smaller treatises, notably one on the Sanskrit accents, <i>Über den
Accent im Sanskrit</i> (1843). But his <i>magnum opus</i> is his great
Sanskrit dictionary, <i>Sanskrit-Wörterbuch</i> (7 vols., St Petersburg,
1853-1875; new ed. 7 vols., St Petersburg, 1879-1889), which with
the assistance of his two friends, Rudolf Roth (1821-1895) and
Albrecht Weber (b. 1825), was completed in twenty-three years.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOHUN,<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> the name of a family which plays an important part in
English history during the 13th and 14th centuries; it was taken
from a village situated in the Cotentin between Coutances and
the estuary of the Vire. The Bohuns came into England at, or
shortly after, the Norman Conquest; but their early history
there is obscure. The founder of their greatness was Humphrey
III., who in the latter years of Henry I., makes his appearance
as a <i>dapifer</i>, or steward, in the royal household. He married
the daughter of Milo of Gloucester, and played an ambiguous
part in Stephen&rsquo;s reign, siding at first with the king and afterwards
with the empress. Humphrey III. lived until 1187, but
his history is uneventful. He remained loyal to Henry II.
through all changes, and fought in 1173 at Farnham against
the rebels of East Anglia. Outliving his eldest son, Humphrey
IV., he was succeeded in the family estates by his grandson
Henry. Henry was connected with the royal house of Scotland
through his mother Margaret, a sister of William the Lion;
an alliance which no doubt assisted him to obtain the earldom
of Hereford from John (1199). The lands of the family lay
chiefly on the Welsh Marches, and from this date the Bohuns
take a foremost place among the Marcher barons. Henry de
Bohun figures with the earls of Clare and Gloucester among the
twenty-five barons who were elected by their fellows to enforce
the terms of the Great Charter. In the subsequent civil war he
fought on the side of Louis, and was captured at the battle of
Lincoln (1217). He took the cross in the same year and died
on his pilgrimage (June 1, 1220). Humphrey V., his son and
heir, returned to the path of loyalty, and was permitted, some
time before 1239, to inherit the earldom of Essex from his
maternal uncle, William de Mandeville. But in 1258 this
Humphrey fell away, like his father, from the royal to the
baronial cause. He served as a nominee of the opposition on the
committee of twenty-four which was appointed, in the Oxford
parliament of that year, to reform the administration. It was
only the alliance of Montfort with Llewelyn of North Wales that
brought the earl of Hereford back to his allegiance. Humphrey
V. headed the first secession of the Welsh Marchers from the
party of the opposition (1263), and was amongst the captives
whom the Montfortians took at Lewes. The earl&rsquo;s son and namesake
was on the victorious side, and shared in the defeat of
Evesham, which he did not long survive. Humphrey V. was,
therefore, naturally selected as one of the twelve arbitrators
to draw up the ban of Kenilworth (1266), by which the disinherited
rebels were allowed to make their peace. Dying in
1275, he was succeeded by his grandson Humphrey VII. This
Bohun lives in history as one of the recalcitrant barons of the year
1297, who extorted from Edward I. the <i>Confirmatio Cartarum</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span>
The motives of the earl&rsquo;s defiance were not altogether disinterested.
He had suffered twice from the chicanery of Edward&rsquo;s
lawyers; in 1284 when a dispute between himself and the royal
favourite, John Giffard, was decided in the latter&rsquo;s favour;
and again in 1292 when he was punished with temporary imprisonment
and sequestration for a technical, and apparently
unwitting, contempt of the king&rsquo;s court. In company, therefore,
with the earl of Norfolk he refused to render foreign service in
Gascony, on the plea that they were only bound to serve with the
king, who was himself bound for Flanders. Their attitude
brought to a head the general discontent which Edward had
excited by his arbitrary taxation; and Edward was obliged
to make a surrender on all the subjects of complaint. At
Falkirk (1298) Humphrey VII. redeemed his character for
loyalty. His son, Humphrey VIII., who succeeded him in the
same year, was allowed to marry one of the king&rsquo;s daughters,
Eleanor, the widowed countess of Holland (1302). This close
connexion with the royal house did not prevent him, as it did
not prevent Earl Thomas of Lancaster, from joining the opposition
to the feeble Edward II. In 1310 Humphrey VIII. figured
among the Lords Ordainers; though, with more patriotism
than some of his fellow-commissioners, he afterwards followed
the king to Bannockburn. He was taken captive in the battle,
but exchanged for the wife of Robert Bruce. Subsequently he
returned to the cause of his order, and fell on the side of Earl
Thomas at the field of Boroughbridge (1322). With him, as with
his father, the politics of the Marches had been the main consideration;
his final change of side was due to jealousy of
the younger Despenser, whose lordship of Glamorgan was too
great for the comfort of the Bohuns in Brecon. With the death
of Humphrey VIII. the fortunes of the family enter on a more
peaceful stage. Earl John (d. 1335) was inconspicuous;
Humphrey IX. (d. 1361) merely distinguished himself as a
captain in the Breton campaigns of the Hundred Years&rsquo; War,
winning the victories of Morlaix (1342) and La Roche Derrien
(1347). His nephew and heir, Humphrey X., who inherited
the earldom of Northampton from his father, was territorially
the most important representative of the Bohuns. But the male
line was extinguished by his death (1373). The three earldoms
and the broad lands of the Bohuns were divided between two
co-heiresses. Both married members of the royal house. The
elder, Eleanor, was given in 1374 to Thomas of Woodstock,
seventh son of Edward III.; the younger, Mary, to Henry,
earl of Derby, son of John of Gaunt and afterwards Henry IV.,
in 1380 or 1381. From these two marriages sprang the houses
of Lancaster and Stafford.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOIARDO, MATTEO MARIA,<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> <span class="sc">Count</span> (1434-1404), Italian
poet, who came of a noble and illustrious house established at
Ferrara, but originally from Reggio, was born at Scandiano,
one of the seignorial estates of his family, near Reggio di Modena,
about the year 1434, according to Tiraboschi, or 1420 according
to Mazzuchelli. At an early age he entered the university of
Ferrara, where he acquired a good knowledge of Greek and
Latin, and even of the Oriental languages, and was in due time
admitted doctor in philosophy and in law. At the court of
Ferrara, where he enjoyed the favour of Duke Borso d&rsquo;Este and
his successor Hercules, he was entrusted with several honourable
employments, and in particular was named governor of Reggio,
an appointment which he held in the year 1478. Three years
afterwards he was elected captain of Modena, and reappointed
governor of the town and citadel of Reggio, where he died in the
year 1494, though in what month is uncertain.</p>

<p>Almost all Boiardo&rsquo;s works, and especially his great poem
of the <i>Orlando Inamorato</i>, were composed for the amusement
of Duke Hercules and his court, though not written within its
precincts. His practice, it is said, was to retire to Scandiano or
some other of his estates, and there to devote himself to composition;
and Castelvetro, Vallisnieri, Mazzuchelli and Tiraboschi
all unite in stating that he took care to insert in the
descriptions of his poem those of the agreeable environs of his
chateau, and that the greater part of the names of his heroes, as
Mandricardo, Gradasse, Sacripant, Agramant and others, were
merely the names of some of his peasants, which, from their
uncouthness, appeared to him proper to be given to Saracen
warriors. Be this as it may, the <i>Orlando Inamorato</i> deserves
to be considered as one of the most important poems in Italian
literature, since it forms the first example of the romantic epic
worthy to serve as a model, and, as such, undoubtedly produced
Ariosto&rsquo;s <i>Orlando Furioso</i>. Gravina and Mazzuchell have said,
and succeeding writers have repeated on their authority, that
Boiardo proposed to himself as his model the <i>Iliad</i> of Homer;
that Paris is besieged like the city of Troy; that Angelica holds
the place of Helen; and that, in short, the one poem is a sort of
reflex image of the other. In point of fact, however, the subject-matter
of the poem is derived from the <i>Fabulous Chronicle</i> of the
pseudo-Turpin; though, with the exception of the names of
Charlemagne, Roland, Oliver, and some other principal warriors,
who necessarily figure as important characters in the various
scenes, there is little resemblance between the detailed plot of the
one and that of the other. The poem, which Boiardo did not
live to finish, was printed at Scandiano the year after his death,
under the superintendence of his son Count Camillo. The title
of the book is without date; but a Latin letter from Antonia
Caraffa di Reggio, prefixed to the poem, is dated the kalends of
June 1495. A second edition, also without date, but which
must have been printed before the year 1500, appeared at
Venice; and the poem was twice reprinted there during the
first twenty years of the 16th century. These editions are the
more curious and valuable since they contain nothing but the
text of the author, which is comprised in three books, divided
into cantos, the third book being incomplete. But Niccolo
degli Agostini, an indifferent poet, had the courage to continue
the work commenced by Boiardo, adding to it three books,
which were printed at Venice in 1526-1531, in 4to; and since
that time no edition of the <i>Orlando</i> has been printed without
the continuation of Agostini, wretched as it unquestionably is.
Boiardo&rsquo;s poem suffers from the incurable defect of a laboured
and heavy style. His story is skilfully constructed, the characters
are well drawn and sustained throughout; many of the incidents
show a power and fertility of imagination not inferior to that of
Ariosto, but the perfect workmanship indispensable for a great
work of art is wanting. The poem in its original shape was not
popular, and has been completely superseded by the <i>Rifacimento</i>
of Francesco Berni (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>The other works of Boiardo are&mdash;(1) <i>Il Timone</i>, a comedy,
Scandiano, 1500, 4to; (2) <i>Sonnetti e Canzoni</i>, Reggio, 1499,
4to; (3) <i>Carmen Bucolicon</i>, Reggio, 1500, 4to; (4) <i>Cinque
Capitoli in terza rima</i>, Venice, 1523 or 1533; (5) <i>Apulejo dell&rsquo;

<p><span class="bold">BOIE, HEINRICH CHRISTIAN<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> (1744-1806), German author,
was born at Meldorf in the then Danish province of Schleswig-Holstein
on the 19th of July 1744. After studying law at Jena,
he went in 1769 to Göttingen, where he became one of the
leading spirits in the Göttingen &ldquo;Dichterbund&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hain.&rdquo;
Boie&rsquo;s poetical talent was not great, but his thorough knowledge
of literature, his excellent taste and sound judgment, made him
an ideal person to awake the poetical genius of others. Together
with F.W. Gotter (<i>q.v.</i>) he founded in 1770 the Göttingen
<i>Musenalmanach</i>, which he directed and edited until 1775, when,
in conjunction with C.W. von Dohm (1751-1820), he brought
out <i>Das deutsche Museum</i>, which became one of the best literary
periodicals of the day. In 1776 Boie became secretary to the
commander-in-chief at Hanover, and in 1781 was appointed
administrator of the province of Süderditmarschen in Holstein.
He died at Meldorf on the 3rd of March 1806.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOIELDIEU, FRANÇOIS ADRIEN<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> (1775-1834), French
composer of comic opera, was born at Rouen on the 15th of
December 1775. He received his first musical education from
M. Broche, the cathedral organist, who appears to have treated
him very harshly. He began composing songs and chamber
music at a very early age-his first opera, <i>La Fille coupable</i>
(the libretto by his father), and his second opera, <i>Rosalie et
Myrza</i>, being produced on the stage of Rouen in 1795. Not
satisfied with his local success he went to Paris in 1795. His
scores were submitted to Cherubini, Méhul and others, but met
with little approbation. Grand opera was the order of the day.
Boieldieu had to fall back on his talent as a pianoforte-player for
a livelihood. Success came at last from an unexpected source.
P.J. Garat, a fashionable singer of the period, admired Boieldleu&rsquo;s
touch on the piano, and made him his accompanist. In the
drawing-rooms of the Directoire Garat sang the charming songs
and ballads with which the young composer supplied him.
Thus Boieldieu&rsquo;s reputation gradually extended to wider circles.
In 1796 <i>Les Deux lettres</i> was produced, and in 1797 <i>La Famille
suisse</i> appeared for the first time on a Paris stage, and was well
received. Several other operas followed in rapid succession, of
which only <i>Le Calife de Bagdad</i> (1800) has escaped oblivion.
After the enormous success of this work, Boieldieu felt the want
of a thorough musical training and took lessons from Cherubini,
the influence of that great master being clearly discernible in
the higher artistic finish of his pupil&rsquo;s later compositions. In
1802 Boieldieu, to escape the domestic troubles caused by his
marriage with Clotilde Aug. Mafleuroy, a celebrated ballet-dancer
of the Paris opera, took flight and went to Russia, where
he was received with open arms by the emperor Alexander.
During his prolonged stay at St Petersburg he composed a
number of operas. He also set to music the choruses of Racine&rsquo;s
<i>Athalie</i>, one of his few attempts at the tragic style of dramatic
writing. In 1811 he returned to his own country, where the
following year witnessed the production of one of his finest works,
<i>Jean de Paris</i>, in which he depicted with much felicity the
charming coquetry of the queen of Navarre, the chivalrous <i>verve</i>
of the king, the officious pedantry of the seneschal, and the
amorous tenderness of the page. He succeeded Méhul as
professor of composition at the Conservatoire in 1817. <i>Le
Chapeau rouge</i> was produced with great success in 1818.
Boieldieu&rsquo;s second and greatest masterpiece was his <i>Dame
blanche</i> (1825). The libretto, written by Scribe, was partly
suggested by Walter Scott&rsquo;s <i>Monastery</i>, and several original
Scottish tunes cleverly introduced by the composer add to the
melodious charm and local colour of the work. On the death
of his wife in 1825, Boieldieu married a singer. His own death
was due to a violent attack of pulmonary disease. He vainly
tried to escape the rapid progress of the illness by travel in Italy
and the south of France, but returned to Paris only to die on
the 8th of October 1834.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOIGNE, BENOÎT DE,<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> <span class="sc">Count</span> (1751-1830), the first of the
French military adventurers in India, was born at Chambéry
in Savoy on the 8th of March 1751, being the son of a fur
merchant. He joined the Irish Brigade in France in 1768, and
subsequently he entered the Russian service and was captured
by the Turks. Hearing of the wealth of India, he made his way
to that country, and after serving for a short time in the East
India Company, he resigned and joined Mahadji Sindhia in
1784 for the purpose of training his troops in the European
methods of war. In the battles of Lalsot and Chaksana Boigne
and his two battalions proved their worth by holding the field
when the rest of the Mahratta army was defeated by the Rajputs.
In the battle of Agra (1788) he restored the Mahratta fortunes,
and made Mahadji Sindhia undisputed master of Hindostan.
This success led to his being given the command of a brigade
of ten battalions of infantry, with which he won the victories
of Patan and Merta in 1790. In consequence Boigne was allowed
to raise two further brigades of disciplined infantry, and made
commander-in-chief of Sindhia&rsquo;s army. In the battle of Lakhairi
(1793) he defeated Holkar&rsquo;s army. On the death of Mahadji
Sindhia in 1794, Boigne could have made himself master of
Hindostan had he wished it, but he remained loyal to Daulat
Rao Sindhia. In 1795 his health began to fail, and he resigned
his command, and in the following year returned to Europe
with a fortune of £400,000. He lived in retirement during
the lifetime of Napoleon, but was greatly honoured by Louis
XVIII. He died on the 21st of June 1830.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOII<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (perhaps = &ldquo;the terrible&rdquo;), a Celtic people, whose original
home was Gallia Transalpina. They were known to the Romans,
at least by name, in the time of Plautus, as is shown by the
contemptuous reference in the <i>Captivi</i> (888). At an early date
they split up into two main groups, one of which made its way
into Italy, the other into Germany. Some, however, appear
to have stayed behind, since, during the Second Punic War,
Magalus, a Boian prince, offered to show Hannibal the way into
Italy after he had crossed the Pyrenees (Livy xxi. 29). The
first group of immigrants is said to have crossed the Pennine Alps
(Great St Bernard) into the valley of the Po. Finding the
district already occupied, they proceeded over the river, drove
out the Etruscans and Umbrians, and established themselves
as far as the Apennines in the modern Romagna. According
to Cato (in Pliny, <i>Nat. Hist.</i> iii. 116) they comprised as many
as 112 different tribes, and from the remains discovered in the
tombs at Hallstatt, La Tène and other places, they appear to
have been fairly civilized. Several wars took place between them
and the Romans. In 283 they were defeated, together with
the Etruscans, at the Vadimonian lake; in 224, after the battle
of Telamon in Etruria, they were forced to submit. But they still
cherished a hatred of the Romans, and during the Second Punic
War (218), irritated by the foundation of the Roman colonies
of Cremona and Placentia, they rendered valuable assistance to
Hannibal. They continued the struggle against Rome from
201 to 191, when they were finally subdued by P. Cornelius Scipio
Nasica, and deprived of nearly half their territory. According
to Strabo (v. p. 213) the Boii were driven back across the Alps
and settled on the land of their kinsmen, the Taurisci, on the
Danube, adjoining Vindelicia and Raetia. Most authorities,
however, assume that there had been a settlement of the Boii
on the Danube from very early times, in part of the modern
Bohemia (anc. <i>Boiohemum</i>, &ldquo;land of the Boii&rdquo;). About 60 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
some of the Boii migrated to Noricum and Pannonia, when
32,000 of them joined the expedition of the Helvetians into
Gaul, and shared their defeat near Bibracte (58). They were
subsequently allowed by Caesar to settle in the territory of the
Aedui between the Loire and the Allier. Their chief town was
Gorgobina (site uncertain). Those who remained on the Danube
were exterminated by the Dacian king, Boerebista, and the
district they had occupied was afterwards called the &ldquo;desert of
the Boii&rdquo; (Strabo vii. p. 292). In <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 69 a Boian named
Mariccus stirred up a fanatical revolt, but was soon defeated
and put to death. Some remnants of the Boii are mentioned
as dwelling near Bordeaux; but Mommsen inclines to the opinion
that the three groups (in Bordeaux, Bohemia and the Po
districts) were not really scattered branches of one and the same
stock, but that they are instances of a mere similarity of name.</p>

<p>The Boii, as we know them, belonged almost certainly to the
Early Iron age. They probably used long iron swords for dealing
cutting blows, and from the size of the handles they must have
been a race of large men (cf. Polybius ii. 30). For their
ethnological affinities and especially their possible connexion with
the Homeric Achaeans see W. Ridgeway&rsquo;s <i>Early Age of Greece</i>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOILEAU-DESPRÉAUX, NICOLAS<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> (1636-1711), French
poet and critic, was born on the 1st of November 1636 in the
rue de Jérusalem, Paris. The same Despréaux was derived
from a small property at Crosne near Villeneuve Saint-Georges.
He was the fifteenth child of Gilles Boileau, a clerk in the
parlement. Two of his brothers attained some distinction: Gilles
Boileau (1631-1669), the author of a translation of Epictetus;
and Jacques Boileau, who became a canon of the Sainte-Chapelle,
and made valuable contributions to church history. His mother
died when he was two years old; and Nicolas Boileau, who had
a delicate constitution, seems to have suffered something from
want of care. Sainte-Beuve puts down his somewhat hard and
unsympathetic outlook quite as much to the uninspiring circumstances
of these days as to the general character of his time.
He cannot be said to have been early disenchanted, for he never
seems to have had any illusions; he grew up with a single passion,
&ldquo;the hatred of stupid books.&rdquo; He was educated at the Collège
de Beauvais, and was then sent to study theology at the Sorbonne.
He exchanged theology for law, however, and was called
to the bar on the 4th of December 1656. From the profession
of law, after a short trial, he recoiled in disgust, complaining
bitterly of the amount of chicanery which passed under the name
of law and justice. His father died in 1657, leaving him a small
fortune, and thenceforward he devoted himself to letters.</p>

<p>Such of his early poems as have been preserved hardly contain
the promise of what he ultimately became. The first piece in
which his peculiar powers were displayed was the first satire
(1660), in imitation of the third satire of Juvenal; it embodied
the farewell of a poet to the city of Paris. This was quickly
followed by eight others, and the number was at a later period
increased to twelve. A twofold interest attaches to the satires.
In the first place the author skilfully parodies and attacks
writers who at the time were placed in the very first rank, such
as Jean Chapelain, the abbé Charles Cotin, Philippe Quinault
and Georges de Scudéry; he openly raised the standard of
revolt against the older poets. But in the second place he showed
both by precept and practice what were the poetical capabilities
of the French language. Prose in the hands of such writers as
Descartes and Pascal had proved itself a flexible and powerful
instrument of expression, with a distinct mechanism and form.
But except with Malherbe, there had been no attempt to fashion
French versification according to rule or method. In Boileau
for the first time appeared terseness and vigour of expression,
with perfect regularity of verse structure. His admiration for
Molière found expression in the stanzas addressed to him (1663),
and in the second satire (1664). In 1664 he composed his prose
<i>Dialogue des héros de roman</i>, a satire on the elaborate romances
of the time, which may be said to have once for all abolished
the lucubrations of La Calprenède, Mlle de Scudéry and their
fellows. Though fairly widely read in manuscript, the book
was not published till 1713, out of regard, it is said, for Mlle
de Scudéry. To these early days belong the reunions at the
<i>Moulon Blanc</i> and the <i>Pomme du Pin</i>, where Boileau, Molière,
Racine, Chapelle and Antoine Furetière met to discuss literary
questions. To Molière and Racine he proved a constant friend,
and supported their interests on many occasions.</p>

<p>In 1666, prompted by the publication of two unauthorized
editions, he published <i>Satires du Sieur D....</i>, containing
seven satires and the <i>Discours au roi</i>. From 1669 onwards
appeared his epistles, graver in tone than the satires, maturer
in thought, more exquisite and polished in style. The <i>Épitres</i>
gained for him the favour of Louis XIV., who desired his presence
at court. The king asked him which he thought his best verses.
Whereupon Boileau diplomatically selected as his &ldquo;least bad&rdquo;
some still unprinted lines in honour of the grand monarch and
proceeded to recite them. He received forthwith a pension of
2000 livres. In 1674 his two masterpieces, <i>L&rsquo;Art poétique</i> and
<i>Le Lutrin</i>, were published with some earlier works as the <i>&OElig;uvres
diverses du sieur D....</i> The first, in imitation of the <i>Ars
Poetica</i> of Horace, lays down the code for all future French
verse, and may be said to fill in French literature a parallel place
to that held by its prototype in Latin. On English literature
the maxims of Boileau, through the translation revised by
Dryden, and through the magnificent imitation of them in
Pope&rsquo;s <i>Essay on Criticism</i>, have exercised no slight influence.
Boileau does not merely lay down rules for the language of poetry,
but analyses carefully the various kinds of verse composition,
and enunciates the principles peculiar to each. Of the four books
of <i>L&rsquo;Art poétique</i>, the first and last consist of general precepts,
inculcating mainly the great rule of <i>bon sens</i>; the second treats
of the pastoral, the elegy, the ode, the epigram and satire; and
the third of tragic and epic poetry. Though the rules laid down
are of value, their tendency is rather to hamper and render too
mechanical the efforts of poetry. Boileau himself, a great,
though by no means infallible critic in verse, cannot be considered
a great poet. He rendered the utmost service in destroying the
exaggerated reputations of the mediocrities of his time, but
his judgment was sometimes at fault. The <i>Lutrin</i>, a mock
heroic poem, of which four cantos appeared in 1674, furnished
Alexander Pope with a model for the <i>Rape of the Lock</i>, but the
English poem is superior in richness of imagination and subtlety
of invention. The fifth and sixth cantos, afterwards added by
Boileau, rather detract from the beauty of the poem; the last
canto in particular is quite unworthy of his genius. In 1674
appeared also his translation of Longinus <i>On the Sublime</i>, to
which were added in 1693 certain critical reflections, chiefly
directed against the theory of the superiority of the moderns
over the ancients as advanced by Charles Perrault.</p>

<p>Boileau was made historiographer to the king in 1677. From
this time the amount of his production diminished. To this
period of his life belong the satire, <i>Sur les femmes</i>, the ode, <i>Sur
la prise de Namur</i>, the epistles, <i>À mes vers</i> and <i>Sur l&rsquo;amour de
Dieu</i>, and the satire <i>Sur l&rsquo;homme</i>. The satires had raised up a
crowd of enemies against Boileau. The 10th satire, on women,
provoked an <i>Apologie des femmes</i> from Charles Perrault.
Antoine Arnauld in the year of his death wrote a letter in defence
of Boileau, but when at the desire of his friends he submitted
his reply to Bossuet, the bishop pronounced all satire to be
incompatible with the spirit of Christianity, and the 10th satire
to be subversive of morality. The friends of Arnauld had
declared that it was inconsistent with the dignity of a churchman
to write on any subject so trivial as poetry. The epistle,
<i>Sur l&rsquo;amour de Dieu</i>, was a triumphant vindication on the part
of Boileau of the dignity of his art. It was not until the 15th
of April 1684 that he was admitted to the Academy, and then
only by the king&rsquo;s wish. In 1687 he retired to a country-house
he had bought at Auteuil, which Racine, because of the numerous
guests, calls his <i>hôtellerie d&rsquo;Auteuil</i>. In 1705 he sold his house
and returned to Paris, where he lived with his confessor in the
cloisters of Notre Dame. In the 12th satire, <i>Sur l&rsquo;équivoque</i>,
he attacked the Jesuits in verses which Sainte-Beuve called a
recapitulation of the <i>Lettres provinciales</i> of Pascal. This was
written about 1705. He then gave his attention to the arrangement
of a complete and definitive edition of his works. But
the Jesuit fathers obtained from Louis XIV. the withdrawal of
the privilege already granted for the publication, and demanded
the suppression of the 12th satire. These annoyances are said to
have hastened his death, which took place on the 13th of March 1711.</p>

<p>Boileau was a man of warm and kindly feelings, honest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span>
outspoken and benevolent. Many anecdotes are told of his
frankness of speech at court, and of his generous actions. He
holds a well-defined place in French literature, as the first who
reduced its versification to rule, and taught the value of workmanship
for its own sake. His influence on English literature, through
Pope and his contemporaries, was not less strong, though less
durable. After much undue depreciation Boileau&rsquo;s critical work
has been rehabilitated by recent writers, perhaps to the extent
of some exaggeration in the other direction. It has been shown
that in spite of undue harshness in individual cases most of his
criticisms have been substantially adopted by his successors.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Numerous editions of Boileau&rsquo;s works were published during his
lifetime. The last of these, <i>&OElig;uvres diverses</i> (1701), known as the
&ldquo;favourite&rdquo; edition of the poet, was reprinted with variants and
notes by Alphonse Pauly (2 vols., 1894). The critical text of his
works was established by Berriat Saint-Prix, <i>&OElig;uvres de Boileau</i>
(4 vols., 1830-1837), who made use of some 350 editions. This text,
edited with notes by Paul Chéron, with the <i>Boloeana</i> of 1740, and
an essay by Sainte-Beuve, was reprinted by Garnier <i>frères</i> (1860).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOILER,<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> a vessel in which water or other liquid is heated to
the boiling point; specifically, the apparatus by which steam is
produced from water, as one step in the process whereby the
potential energy of coal or other fuel is converted into mechanical
work by means of the steam-engine. Boilers of the latter kind
must all possess certain essential features, whilst of other qualities
that are desirable some may not be altogether compatible with
the special conditions under which the boilers are to be worked.
Amongst the essentials are a receptacle capable of containing
the water and the steam produced by its evaporation, and strong
enough continuously to withstand with safety the highest pressure
of steam for which the boiler is intended. Another essential is a
furnace for burning the fuel, and a further one is the provision of
a sufficiency of heating surface for the transmission of the heat
produced by the combustion of the fuel to the water which is
required to be evaporated. Desirable qualities are that the
arrangements of the furnaces should be such that a reasonably
perfect combustion of the fuel should be possible, and that the
heating surfaces should be capable of transmitting a large
proportion of the heat produced to the water so as to obtain a
high evaporative efficiency. Further, the design generally should
be compact, not too heavy or costly, and such that the cleaning
necessary to maintain the evaporative efficiency can be easily
effected. It should also be such that the cost of upkeep will be
small, and that only an average amount of skill and attention
will be required under working conditions. It is for providing
these qualities in different degrees according to the special
requirements of various circumstances that the very different
designs of the various types of boilers have been evolved.</p>

<p><i>Classes of Boilers.</i>&mdash;Boilers generally may be divided into two
distinct classes, one comprising those which are generally called
&ldquo;tank&rdquo; boilers, containing relatively large quantities of water,
and the other those which are generally called &ldquo;water-tube&rdquo;
boilers, in which the water is mainly contained in numerous
comparatively small tubes. There are, however, some types of
boiler which combine to some extent the properties of both these
classes. Each class has its representatives amongst both land
and marine boilers. In &ldquo;tank&rdquo; boilers the outer shell is wholly
or partially cylindrical, this form being one in which the necessary
strength can be obtained without the use of a large number of
stays. The boilers are generally internally fired, the furnace
plates being surrounded with water and forming the most efficient
portion of the heating surfaces. On leaving the furnace the
products of combustion are led into a chamber and thence
through flues or through numerous small tubes which serve to
transmit some of the heat of combustion to the water contained
in the boiler. In &ldquo;water-tube&rdquo; boilers the fire is usually placed
under a collection of tubes containing water and forming the
major portion of the heating surface of the boiler. Both the
fire and the tubes are enclosed in an outer casing of brickwork
or other fire-resisting substance. In some forms of water-tube
boiler the fire is entirely surrounded by water-tubes and the
casing is in no part exposed to the direct action of the fire. In
&ldquo;tank&rdquo; boilers generally no difficulty is experienced in keeping
all the heating surfaces in close contact with water, but in
&ldquo;water-tube&rdquo; boilers special provision has to be made in the
design for maintaining the circulation of water through the
tubes. (For &ldquo;flash&rdquo; boilers see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Motor Vehicles</a></span>, and for
domestic hot-water boilers <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Heating</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Tank Boilers.</i>&mdash;Of large stationary boilers the forms most
commonly used are those known as the &ldquo;Lancashire&rdquo; boiler, and
its modification the &ldquo;Galloway&rdquo; boiler. These boilers
are made from 26 to 30 ft. long, with diameters from 6½ to
<span class="sidenote">Lancashire.</span>
8 ft., and have two cylindrical furnace flues which in the
&ldquo;Lancashire&rdquo; boiler extend for its whole length (see fig. 3). The
working pressure is about 60 &#8468; per sq. in. in the older boilers, from
100 &#8468; to 120 &#8468; per sq. in. in those supplying steam to compound
engines, and from 150 to 170 &#8468; where triple expansion
engines are used. In some cases they have been constructed for a
pressure of 200 &#8468; per sq. in. The furnace flues are usually
made in sections from 3 to 3½ ft. long. Each section consists of one
plate bent into a cylindrical form, the longitudinal joint being
welded, and is flanged at both ends, the
various pieces being joined together by an
&ldquo;Adamson&rdquo; joint (fig. 1.). It will be seen
that these joints do not expose either rivets
or double thickness of plate to the action of
the fire; they further serve as stiffening
rings to prevent collapse of the flue. In
most of these boilers the heating surface is
increased by fitting in the furnace flues a
number of &ldquo;Galloway&rdquo; tubes. These are
conical tubes, made with a flange at each end, by means of which
they are connected to the furnace plate. They are so proportioned
that the diameter of the large end of the tube is slightly greater
than that of the flange of the small end; this enables them to be
readily removed and replaced if necessary. These tubes not only
add to the heating surface, but they stiffen the flue, promote
circulation of the water in the boiler, and by mixing up the flue
gases improve the evaporative efficiency.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Galloway&rdquo; boiler the two furnaces extend only for about
9 or 10 ft. into the boiler, and lead into a large chamber or flue in
which a number of &ldquo;Galloway&rdquo; tubes are fitted, and which extends
from the furnace end to the end of the boiler. A cross section of this
flue showing the distribution of the Galloway tubes is shown in
fig. 2. When boilers less than about 6½ ft. in diameter are needed,
a somewhat similar type to the Lancashire boiler is used containing
only one furnace. This is called a &ldquo;Cornish&rdquo; boiler.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 370px;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption1"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 2.&mdash;Galloway Boiler: Section beyond the Bridge.</td></tr></table>

<p>In all three types of boiler the brickwork is constructed to form
one central flue passing along the bottom of the boiler and two side
flues extending up the side nearly to the water-level.  A cross section
of the brickwork is shown in fig. 2. The usual arrangement is for
the flue gases to be divided as they leave the internal flue; one-half
returns along each side flue to the front of the boiler, and the whole
then passes downwards into the central flue, travelling under the
bottom of the boiler until the gases again reach the back end,
where they pass into the chimney. In a few cases the arrangement
is reversed, the gases first passing along the bottom flue and returning
along the side flues. This latter arrangement,
whilst promoting a more rapid circulation of water, has the disadvantage
of requiring two dampers, and it is not suitable for those
cases in which heavy deposits form on the bottoms of the boilers.</p>

<p>Where floor space is limited and also for small installations, other
forms of cylindrical boilers are used, most of them being of the
vertical type. That most commonly used is the simple
vertical boiler, with a plain vertical fire-box, and an internal
<span class="sidenote">Vertical.</span>
smoke stack traversing the steam space. The fire-box is made slightly
tapering in diameter, the space between it and the shell being filled
with water. In all but the small sizes cross tubes are generally fitted.
These are made about 9 in. in diameter of <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span>-in. plate flanged at
each end to enable them to be riveted to the fire-box plates. They are
usually fitted with a slight inclination to facilitate water circulation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>142</span>
and a hand-hole closed by a suitable door is provided in the outer
shell opposite to each tube for cleaning purposes. A boiler of
this kind is illustrated in fig. 4. This form is often used on board
ship for auxiliary purposes. Where more heating surface is required
than can be obtained in the cross-tube boiler other types of vertical
boiler are employed. For instance, in the &ldquo;Tyne&rdquo; boiler (fig. 5)
the furnace is hemispherical, and the products of combustion are led
into an upper combustion chamber traversed by four or more
inclined water-tubes of about 9 in. diameter and by several vertical
water-tubes of less diameter. In the &ldquo;Victoria&rdquo; boiler made by
Messrs Clarke, Chapman &amp; Co., and illustrated in fig. 6, the furnace
is hemispherical; the furnace gases are led to an internal combustion
chamber, and thence through numerous horizontal smoke-tubes
to a smoke-box placed on the side of the boiler. In the somewhat
similar boiler known as the &ldquo;Cochran,&rdquo; the combustion chamber is
made with a &ldquo;dry&rdquo; back. Instead of a water space at the back of
the chamber, doors lined with firebrick are fitted. These give easy
access to the tube ends.</p>

<p>The cylindrical multitubular
return tube boiler is in
almost universal use in
merchant steamers. It is made in
various sizes ranging up to 17 ft.
in diameter, the usual working
pressure being from 160 to 200 &#8468;
<span class="sidenote">Marine.</span>
per sq. in., although in some
few cases pressures of 265 &#8468; per
sq. in. are in use. These boilers
are of two types, double- and
single-ended. In single-ended
boilers, which are those most generally
used, the furnaces are fitted at
one end only and vary in number
from one in the smallest boiler
to four in the largest. Three
furnaces are the most usual practice.
Each furnace generally has its own
separate combustion chamber. In
four furnace boilers, however, one
chamber is sometimes made common
to the two middle furnaces, and
sometimes one chamber is fitted to
each pair of side furnaces. In
double-ended boilers furnaces are
fitted at each end. In some cases
each furnace has a separate
combustion chamber, but more usually
one chamber is made to serve for
two furnaces, one at each end of
the boiler. The two types of boilers
are shown in figs. 7 and 8, which
illustrate boilers made by Messrs
D. Rowan &amp; Co. of Glasgow, and
which may be taken as representing
good modern practice. The furnaces
used in the smaller sizes are
often of the plain cylindrical type,
the thickness of plate varying from
<span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in. up to ¾ in. according to the
diameter of the furnace and the
working pressure. Occasionally
furnaces with &ldquo;Adamson&rdquo; joints
similar to those used in Lancashire
boilers are employed, but for large
furnaces and for high pressures corrugated or ribbed furnaces
are usually adopted. Sketches of the sections of these are shown
in fig. 9. The sections of the Morison, Fox and Deighton types are
made from plates originally rolled of a uniform thickness, made
into a cylindrical form with a welded longitudinal joint and then
corrugated, the only difference between them being in the shapes of
the corrugations. In the other three types the plates from which the
furnaces are made are rolled with ribs or thickened portions at
distances of 9 in. These furnaces are stronger to resist collapse
than plain furnaces of the same thickness, and accommodate themselves
more readily to changes of temperature.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;Vertical Boiler with Water-tubes (the &ldquo;Tyne,&rdquo; by
Messrs Clarke, Chapman &amp; Co.).</td></tr></table>

<p>There are two distinct types of connexion between the furnaces
and the combustion chambers. In one, shown in fig. 8, the furnace
is flanged at the crown portion for riveting to the tube plate, and
the lower part of the furnace is riveted to the &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo; or side
plate of the combustion chamber. In the other type, shown in fig. 7,
and known generally as the &ldquo;Gourlay back end,&rdquo; the end of the
furnace is contracted into an oval conical form, and is then flanged
outwards round the whole of its circumference. The tube plate is
made to extend to the bottom of the combustion chamber, and the
furnace is riveted to the tube plate. The advantage of the Gourlay
back end is that in case of accident to the furnace it can be removed
from the boiler and be replaced by one of the same design without
disturbing the end plates, which is not possible with the other design.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>143</span>
The Gourlay back end, however, is not so stiff as the other, and more
longitudinal stays are required in the boiler.</p>

<p>The flat sides and backs of the combustion chambers are stayed
either to one another or to the shell of the boiler by numerous screw
stays which are screwed through the two plates they connect, and
which are nearly always fitted with nuts inside the combustion
chambers. The tops of the chambers are usually stayed by strong
girders resting upon the tube plates and chamber back plates. In
a few cases, however, they are stayed by vertical stays attached to
T bars riveted to the boiler shell. A few boilers are made in which
the chamber tops are strengthened by heavy transverse girder
plates. The end plates of the boiler in the steam space and below
the combustion chambers are stayed by longitudinal stays passing
through the whole length of the boiler and secured by double nuts
at each end. The tube plates are strengthened by stay tubes screwed
into them.</p>

<p>Where natural or chimney draught is used the tubes are generally
made 3 or 3¼ in. outside diameter and are rarely more than 7 ft.
long, but where &ldquo;forced&rdquo; draught is employed they are usually
made 2½ in. diameter and 8 to 8½ ft. long. A clear space of 1¼ in.
between the tubes is almost always arranged for, irrespective of size
of tubes.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 8.&mdash;Double-ended Marine Boiler.</td></tr></table>

<p>Stay tubes are screwed at both ends, the threads of the two ends
being continuous so that they can be screwed into both tube plates;
occasionally nuts are fitted to the front ends. The stay tubes are
expanded into the plates and then beaded over.</p>

<p>The locomotive boiler consists of a cylindrical barrel attached to
a portion containing the fire-box, which is nearly rectangular both
in horizontal and vertical section. The fire-box sides are
stayed to the fire-box shell by numerous stays about
<span class="sidenote">Locomotive.</span>
1 in. in diameter, usually pitched 4 in. apart both vertically
and horizontally. The top of the fire-box in small boilers is stayed
by means of girder stays running longitudinally and supported at
the ends upon the tube plate and the opposite fire-box plate. In
some boilers the girders are partly supported by slings from the
crown of the boiler. In larger boilers the crown of the boiler above
the fire-box is made flat and the fire-box crown is supported by
vertical stays connecting it with the shell crown. Provision is
generally made for the expansion
of the tube plate, which is of
copper, by allowing the two or
three cross rows of stays nearest
the tube plate to have freedom
of motion upwards but not downwards.
The ordinary tubes are
usually 1¾ in. diameter. The
fire-bars are generally, though not
always, made to slope downwards
away from the fire door,
and just below the lowest tubes
a fire-bridge or baffle is fitted,
extending about half-way from
the tube plate to the fire-door
side of the fire-box. In some
cases water-tubes are fitted,
extending right across the fire-box.
In a boiler for the London &amp;
South-Western Railway Co., having
a grate area of 31.5 sq. ft. and
a total heating surface of 2727 sq.
ft., there are 112 water-tubes
each 2¾ in. diameter. These are
arranged in two clusters, each
containing 56, one set being
placed above the fire-bridge, and
the other set nearer the fire-door
end of the boiler. The
water-tubes are of seamless steel,
and are expanded into the fire-box side plates. In way
of these tubes the outer shell side plates are supported by
stay bars passing right through the water-tubes. The usual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
pressure of locomotive boilers is about 175 &#8468; to 200 &#8468; per sq. in.</p>

<p>A good example of an express locomotive boiler is shown in fig. 10.
In this case the grate area is 30.9 sq. ft. and the heating surface
2500 sq. ft. The barrel is 5 ft. 6 in. diameter, 16 ft. long between
tube plates. The fire-box crown is stayed by vertical stays extending
to the shell crown, except for the three rows of stays nearest the tube
plates. These are supported by cross girders resting upon brackets
secured to the outer shell.</p>

<p><i>Water-Tube Boilers.</i>&mdash;The &ldquo;Babcock &amp; Wilcox&rdquo; boiler, as fitted
for land purposes, and illustrated in fig. 11, consists of a
horizontal cylinder forming a steam chest, having dished ends and
two specially constructed cross-boxes riveted to the
<span class="sidenote">Babcock and Wilcox stationary.</span>
bottom. Under the cylinder is placed a sloping nest of
tubes, under the upper end of which is the fire. The sides
and back of the boiler are enclosed in brickwork up to
the height of the centre of the horizontal cylinder and the
front is fitted with an iron casing lined with brick at the lower part.
Suitable brickwork baffles are arranged between the tubes themselves,
and between the nests of tubes and the cylinder, to ensure a
proper circulation of the products of combustion, which are made to
pass between the tubes three times. The nest of tubes consists of
several separate elements, each formed by a front and back header
made of wrought steel of sinuous form connected by a number of
tubes. The upper ends of the front headers are connected by
short tubes to the front cross-box of the horizontal cylinder, the
lower ends being closed. The upper ends of the back headers are
connected by longer pipes to the back cross-box, and their lower
ends by short pipes to a horizontal mud drum to which a blow-off
cock and pipe are attached. The headers are furnished with holes
on two opposite sides; those on one side form the means of connexion
between the headers and tubes, and the others allow access
for fixing the tubes in position and cleaning. The outer holes are
oval, and closed by special fittings shown in fig. 18, the watertightness
of the joints being secured by the outer cover plates. The holes
being oval, the inside fitting can be placed in position from outside,
and it is so made as to cover the opening and prevent any great
outrush of steam or water should the bolt break. Any desired
working pressure can be provided for in these boilers; in some
special cases it rises as high as 500 &#8468; per sq. in., but a more
usual pressure is 180 &#8468; Like all water-tube boilers, they require to
be frequently cleaned if impure feed-water is used, but the straightness
of their tubes enables their condition to be ascertained at any
time when the boiler is out of use, and any accumulation of scale to
be removed. The superheaters, which are frequently fitted, consist
of two cross-boxes or headers placed transversely under the cylindrical
drum and connected by numerous C-shaped tubes. They
are situated between the tubes and the steam-chest, and are exposed
to the heat of the furnace gases after their first passage across the
tubes. The steam is taken by an internal pipe passing through the
bottom of the drum into the upper cross-box, then through the C tubes
into the lower box, and thence to the steam pipe. When steam is
being raised, the superheater is flooded with water, which is drained
out through a blow-off pipe before communication is opened with
the steam-pipe. In large boilers of this type, two steam-chests are
placed side by side connected together by two cross steam pipes and
by the mud drum. Each, however, has its own separate feed supply.
The largest boiler made has two steam chests 4½ ft. diameter by
25½ ft. long, a grate surface of 85 sq. ft., and a total heating
surface of 6182 sq. ft.</p>

<p>Another type of water-tube boiler in use for stationary purposes
is the &ldquo;Stirling&rdquo; (fig. 12). This boiler consists of four or five
horizontal drums, of which the three upper form the
steam-space, and the one or two lower contain water.
<span class="sidenote">Stirling.</span>
The lower drums, where two are fitted, are connected to each other
at about the middle of their height by horizontal tubes, and to the
upper drums by numerous nearly vertical tubes which form the
major portion of the heating surfaces. The central upper drum is
at a slightly higher level than the others, and communicates with
that nearest the back of the boiler by a set of curved tubes entirely
above the water-level, and with the front drum by two sets&mdash;the
upper one being above and the lower below the water-level. The
whole boiler is enclosed in brickwork, into which the supporting
columns and girders are built. Brickwork baffles
compel the furnace gases to take specified courses among
the tubes. It will be seen that the space between the
boiler front and the tubes form a large combustion
chamber into which all the furnace gases must pass
before they enter the spaces between the tubes; in this
chamber a baffle-bridge is sometimes built. Another
chamber is formed between the first and second sets of tubes.
The feed-water enters the back upper drum, and must pass
down the third set of tubes into the lower drum before it
reaches the other parts of the boiler. Thus the coldest water is
always where the temperature of the furnace gases is lowest; and
as the current through the lower drum is slight, the solid matters
separated from the feed-water while its temperature is being raised
have an opportunity of settling to the bottom of this drum, where
the heating is not great and where therefore their presence will not
be injurious. When superheaters are required, they are made of
two drums connected by numerous small tubes, and are somewhat
similar in construction to the boiler proper. The superheater is
placed between the first and second sets of tubes, where it is
exposed to the furnace gases before too much heat has been taken
from them. Arrangements are provided for flooding the superheater
while steam is being raised, and for draining it before the steam is
passed through it.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar boiler is made by Messrs. Clarke, Chapman &amp; Co.,
and is known as the &ldquo;Woodeson&rdquo; boiler (fig. 13). It consists
of three upper drums placed side by side connected
together by numerous short tubes, some above and some
<span class="sidenote">Woodeson.</span>
below the water-level, and of three smaller lower drums also
connected by short cross tubes. The upper and lower drums are
connected by numerous nearly vertical straight tubes. The whole is
enclosed in firebrick casing. The design permits of the insides
of all the tubes being readily inspected, and also of any tube
being taken out and renewed without displacing any other part
of the boiler.</p>

<p>The earliest form of water-tube boiler which came into general use
in the British navy is the Belleville. Two views of this boiler are
shown in fig. 14. It is composed of two parts, the boiler
proper and the &ldquo;economizer.&rdquo; Each of these consists of
<span class="sidenote">Belleville.</span>
several sets of elements placed side by side; those of the boiler
proper are situated immediately over the fire, and those of the
economizer in the uptake above the boiler, the intervening space
being designed to act as a combustion chamber. Each element is
constructed of a number of straight tubes connected at their ends
by means of screwed joints to junction-boxes which are made of
malleable cast iron. These are arranged vertically over one another,
and except in the case of the upper and lower ones at the front of the
boiler, each connects the upper end of one tube with the lower end
of the next tube of the element. The boxes at the back of the
boiler are all close-ended, but those at the front are provided with
a small oval hole, opposite to each tube end, closed by an internal
door with bolt and cross-bar; the purpose of these openings is to
permit the inside of the tubes to be examined and
cleaned. The lower front box of each element of the
boiler proper is connected to a horizontal cross-tube of
square section, called a &ldquo;feed-collector,&rdquo; which extends
the whole width of the boiler. When the boiler is not in
use, any element can be readily disconnected and a spare
one inserted. The lower part of the steam-chest is
connected to the feed-collector by vertical pipes at each
end of the boiler, and prolongations of these pipes below
the level of the feed-collector form closed pockets for the
collection of sediment. The tubes are made of seamless
steel. They are generally about 4½ in. in external
diameter: the two lower rows are <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in. thick, the next two
rows <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> and the remainder about <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> in. The construction
of the economizer is similar to that of the boiler proper,
but the tubes are shorter and smaller, being generally
about 2¾ in. in diameter. The lower boxes of the economizer
elements are connected to a horizontal feed pipe
which is kept supplied with water by a feed-pumping
engine, and the upper boxes are connected to another
horizontal pipe from which the heated feed-water is taken
into the steam-chest. Both the boiler proper and the
economizer are enclosed in a casing which is formed of
two thicknesses of thin iron separated by non-conducting
material and lined with firebrick at the part between the
fire-bar level and the lower rows of tubes. Along the front
of the boiler, above the level of the firing-doors, there is
a small tube having several nozzles directed across the
fire-grate, and supplied with compressed air at a pressure
of about 10 &#8468; per sq. in. In this way not only
is additional air supplied, but the gases issuing from
the fire are stirred up and mixed, their combustion being
thereby facilitated before they pass into the spaces between the
tubes. A similar air-tube is provided for the space between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>146</span>
boiler proper and the economizer. Any water suspended in the
steam is separated in a special separator fitted in the main
steam-pipe, and the steam is further dried by passing through a
reducing-valve, which ensures a steady pressure on the engine side
of the valve, notwithstanding fluctuations of pressure in the boiler.
The boiler pressure is usually maintained at about 50 &#8468; per sq. in.
in excess of that at which the engines are working, the excess forming
a reservoir of energy to provide for irregular firing or feeding.</p>

<p>Another type of large-tube boiler which has been used in the
British and in other navies is the &ldquo;Niclausse,&rdquo; shown in fig. 15.
It is also in use on land in several electric-light installations.
It consists of a horizontal steam-chest under
<span class="sidenote">Niclausse.</span>
which is placed a number of elements arranged side by side
over the fire, the whole being enclosed in an iron casing lined
with firebrick where it is exposed to the direct action of the fire.
Each element consists of a header of rectangular cross-section,
fitted with two rows of inclined close-ended tubes, which slope
downwards towards the back of the boiler with an inclination of
6° to the horizontal. The headers are usually of malleable cast
iron with diaphragms cast in them, but sometimes steel has been
employed, the bottoms being closed by a riveted steel plate, and
the diaphragms being made of the same material. The headers are
bolted to socket-pieces which are riveted to the bottom of the
steam-chest, so that any element may be easily removed. The
tube-holes are accurately bored, at an angle to suit the inclination
of the tubes, through both the front and back of the headers and
through the diaphragm, those in the header walls being slightly
conical. The tubes themselves, which are made of seamless steel,
are of peculiar construction. The lower or back ends are reduced in
diameter and screwed and fitted with cap-nuts which entirely close
them. The front ends are thickened by being upset, and the parts
where they fit into the header walls and in the diaphragm are
carefully turned to gauge. The upper and lower parts of the tubes
between these fitting portions are then cut away, the side portions
only being retained, and the end is termed a &ldquo;lanterne.&rdquo; A small
water-circulating tube of thin sheet steel, fitted inside each
generating tube, is open at the lower end, and at the other is secured
to a smaller &ldquo;lanterne,&rdquo; which, however, only extends from the front
of the header to the diaphragm. This smaller &ldquo;lanterne&rdquo; closes
the front end of the generating tube. The whole arrangement is
such that when the tubes are in place only the small inner circulating
tubes communicate with the space between the front of the header
and the diaphragm, while the annular spaces in the generating tubes
around the water-circulating tubes communicate only with the space
between the diaphragm and the back of the header. The steam
formed in the tubes escapes from them into this back space, through
which it rises into the steam-chest, whilst the space in the front
of the header always contains a down-current of water supplying
the inner circulating tubes. The tubes are maintained in position
by cross-bars, each secured by one stud-bolt screwed into the header
front wall, and each serving to fix two tubes. The products of
combustion ascend directly from the fire amongst the tubes, and the
combustion is rendered more complete by the introduction of jets of
high-pressure air immediately over the fire, as in the &ldquo;Belleville&rdquo;
boiler.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Dürr&rdquo; boiler, in use in several vessels in the German
navy, and in a few vessels of the British navy, in some
respects resembles the &ldquo;Niclausse.&rdquo; The separate headers of
the latter, however, are replaced by one large water-chamber
<span class="sidenote">Dürr.</span>
formed of steel plates with welded joints, and instead of
the tubes being secured by &ldquo;lanternes&rdquo; to two plates they are
secured to the inner plate only by conical joints, the holes in the
outer plate being closed by small round doors fitted from the inside.
In fixing the tubes each is separately forced into its position by
means of a small portable hydraulic jack. The lower ends of the
caps are closed by cap-nuts made of a special heat-resisting alloy of
copper and manganese. Circulation is provided for by a diaphragm
in the water-chamber and by inner tubes as in the Niclausse boiler.
Baffle plates are fitted amongst the tubes to ensure a circulation
of the furnace gases amongst them. Above the main set of tubes is
a smaller set arranged horizontally, and connected directly to the
steam receiver. These are fitted with internal tubes, and an internal
diaphragm is provided so that steam from the chest circulates through
these tubes on its way to the stop-valves. This
supplementary set of tubes is intended to serve
as a superheater, but the amount of surface is
not sufficient to obtain more than a very small
amount of superheat.</p>

<p>The Yarrow boiler (fig. 16) is largely in use in
the British and also in several other navies. It
consists of a large cylindrical steam
chest and two lower water-chambers,
<span class="sidenote">Yarrow.</span>
connected by numerous straight tubes. In the
boilers for large vessels all the tubes are of 1¾ in.
external diameter, but in the large express boilers
the two rows nearest to the fire on each side are
of 1¼ in. and the remainder of 1 in. diameter.
They are arranged with their centres forming
equilateral triangles, and are spaced so that
they can be cleaned externally both from the
front of the boiler and also cross-ways in two
directions. In some boilers the lower part of
the steam-chest is connected with the water-chambers
by large pipes outside the casings with
the view of improving the circulation.</p>

<p>The largest size of single-ended large tube
boiler in use has a steam drum 4 ft. 2 in.
diameter, a grate area of 73.5 sq. ft. and 3750
sq. ft. of heating surface, but much larger
double-ended boilers have been made, these
being fired from both ends.</p>

<p>In most of the boilers made, access to the
inside is obtained by manholes in the steam-chest
and water-chamber ends, but in the
smaller sizes fitted in torpedo boats the
water-chambers are too small for this, and they are
each arranged in two parts connected by a bolted
joint, which makes all the tube ends accessible.</p>

<p>The Babcock &amp; Wilcox marine boiler (fig. 17) is
much used in the American and British navies, and
it has also been used in several yachts and merchant
steamers. It consists of a horizontal cylindrical
steam-chest placed transversely over a group of elements, beneath
which is the fire, the whole being enclosed in an iron casing lined
with firebrick. Each element consists of a front and back header
connected by numerous water-tubes which have a considerable
inclination to facilitate the circulation. The upper ends of the
front headers are situated immediately under the steam-chest and are
connected to it by short nipples; by a similar means they are
connected at the bottom to a pipe of square section which extends
across the width of the boiler. Additional connexions are made by
nearly vertical tubes between this cross-pipe and the bottom of the
steam-chest. The back headers are each connected at their upper
ends by means of two long horizontal tubes with the steam-chest,
the bottom ends of the headers being closed. The headers are made
of wrought steel, and except the outer pairs, which are flat on the
outer portions, they are sinuous on both sides, the sinuosities fitting
into one another. The tubes are of two sizes, the two lower rows
and the return tubes between the back headers and steam-chest
being 3<span class="spp">15</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> in. outside diameter, and the remaining tubes 1<span class="spp">13</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> in.
The small tubes are arranged in groups of two or four to nearly all
of the sinuosities of the headers, the purpose of this arrangement
being to give opportunities for the furnace gases to become well
mixed together, and to ensure their contact with the heating surfaces.
Access for securing the tubes in the headers is provided by a
hole formed on the other side of the header opposite each of the tubes,
where they are grouped in fours, and by one larger hole opposite
each group of two tubes. The larger holes are oval, and are closed
by fittings similar to those used in the land boiler (fig. 18). The
smaller holes are conical, with the larger diameter on the inside,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span>
and are closed by special conical fittings: the conical portion and
bolt are one forging, and the nut is close-ended. In case of the
breakage of the bolt, the fitting would be retained in place by the
steam-pressure. A set of firebrick baffles is placed so as to cover
rather more than half of the spaces between the upper of the two
bottom rows of large tubes, and another set of baffles covers about
two-thirds of the spaces between the upper small tubes. Vertical
baffles are also built between the smaller tubes, as shown in the
longitudinal section. These baffles compel the products of combustion
to circulate among the tubes in the direction shown by the
arrows. Experience has shown that this arrangement gives a better
evaporative efficiency than where the furnace gases are allowed to
pass unbaffled straight up between the tubes. The boilers are
usually fitted in pairs placed back to back, and one side of each is
always made accessible. On this side the casing is provided with
numerous small doors, through any of which a steam jet can be
inserted for the purpose of sweeping the tubes.</p>

<p>A class of water-tube boilers largely in use in torpedo-boat
destroyers and cruisers, where the maximum of power is required
in proportion to the total weight of the installation, is
generally known as express boilers. In these the tubes
<span class="sidenote">Express boilers.</span>
are made of smaller diameter than those used in the
boilers already described, and the boilers are designed to admit of a
high rate of combustion of fuel obtained by a high degree of &ldquo;forced
draught.&rdquo; Of these express boilers the Yarrow is of similar
construction to the large tube Yarrow boiler already described with
the exception that the tubes are smaller in diameter and much more
closely arranged.</p>

<p>In the Normand boiler (fig. 19) there are three chambers as in the
Yarrow, connected together by a large number of bent tubes which
form the heating surface, and also connected at each end
by large outside circulating tubes. The two outer rows
<span class="sidenote">Normand.</span>
of heating tubes on each side are arranged to touch one another to
nearly their whole length so as to form a &ldquo;water-wall&rdquo; for the
protection of the outer casing. They enter the steam-chest at about
the water-level. The two inner rows of tubes, which are bent to the
form shown in the figure, also form a water-wall for the larger portion
of the length of the boiler, and thus compel the products of
combustion to pass in a definite course amongst all the tubes. In the
Blechynden and White-Foster boilers there are also three chambers
connected by bent tubes, the curvature being so arranged that in the
former boiler any of the tubes can be taken out of the boiler through
small doors provided in the upper part of the steam-chest, and in
the White-Foster boiler they can be taken out through the manhole
in the end of the steam-chest.</p>

<p>In the Reed boiler the tubes are longer and more curved than in
the Normand boiler, and there are no &ldquo;water-walls,&rdquo; the products
of combustion passing from the fire-grate amongst all
the tubes direct to the chimney. The special feature of
<span class="sidenote">Reed.</span>
the boiler is that each tube, instead of being expanded into the
tube plate, is fitted at each end with specially
designed screw and nut connexions to enable
them to be quickly taken out and replaced if
necessary. At their lower ends the tubes are
reduced in diameter to enable smaller chambers
to be used than would otherwise be necessary.
Provision is made for access to the lower tube
ends by means of numerous doors in the water-chambers.
Access to the top ends is obtained in the steam-chest.</p>

<p>Messrs John I. Thornycroft &amp; Co. make
two forms of express boiler. One called the
Thornycroft boiler consists of three
chambers connected by tubes which
are straight for the major portion of
their length but bent at each end to enable
<span class="sidenote">Thornycroft.</span>
them to enter the steam- and water-chambers
normally. The outer rows of tubes form
&ldquo;water-walls&rdquo; at their lower parts, but permit the
passage of the gases between them at their
upper ends. Similarly the inner rows form
&ldquo;water-walls&rdquo; at their upper parts, but are
open at the lower ends. The products of
combustion are thus compelled to pass over the
whole of the heating surfaces. The fire-rows of
tubes in this boiler are made 1<span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in. outside
diameter and the remainder are made 1<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in.
diameter. Large outside circulating pipes are
provided at the front end of the boiler.</p>

<p>In the other type of boiler, known as the
Thornycroft-Schulz boiler (fig. 20), there are four
chambers, and the fire-grate is arranged
in two separate portions. The two
outermost rows of tubes on each side
are arranged to form water-walls at
<span class="sidenote">Thornycroft-Schulz.</span>
their lower part, and permit the gases to pass
between them at the upper part. The rows
nearest the fires are arranged similarly to those
in the Thornycroft boiler. Circulation in the
outer sets of tubes is arranged for by outer
circulating pipes of large diameter connecting the
steam- and water-chambers. For the middle
water-chamber several nearly vertical down-comers
are provided in the centre of the boiler.
Boilers of this type are extensively used in the
British and German navies.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Material of Boilers.</i>&mdash;In ordinary land
boilers and in marine boilers of all types the
plates and stays are almost invariably made
of mild steel. For the shell plates and for
long stays, a quality having a tensile strength
ranging from 28 to 32 tons per sq. in. is usually
employed, and for furnaces and flues, for plates
which have to be flanged, and for short-screwed stays, a somewhat
softer steel with a strength ranging from 26 to 30 tons per sq. in.
is used. The tubes of ordinary land and marine boilers are
usually made of lap-welded wrought iron. In water-tube boilers
for naval purposes seamless steel tubes are invariably used. In
locomotive boilers the shells are generally of mild steel, the
fire-box plates of copper (in America of steel), the fire-box side
stays of copper or special bronze, and other stays of steel. The
tubes are usually of brass with a composition either of two parts
by weight of copper to one of zinc or 70% copper, 30% zinc;
sometimes, however, copper tubes and occasionally steel tubes
are used. Where water tubes are used they are made of seamless steel.</p>

<p><i>Boiler Accessories.</i>&mdash;All boilers must be provided with certain
mountings and accessories. The water-level in them must be
kept above the highest part of the heating surfaces. In some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span>
land boilers, and in some of the water-tube boilers used on
shipboard, the feeding is automatically regulated by mechanism
actuated by a float, but in these cases means of regulating the
feed-supply by hand are also provided. In most boilers hand
regulation only is relied upon. The actual level of water in the
boiler is ascertained by a glass water-gauge, which consists of a
glass tube and three cocks, two communicating directly with the
boiler, one above and one below the desired water-level, and the
third acting as a blow-out for cleaning the gauge and for testing
its working. Three small try-cocks are also fitted, one just at,
one above, and one below the proper water-level. The feeding
of the boiler is sometimes performed by a pump driven from the
main engine, sometimes by an independent steam-pump, and
sometimes by means of an injector. The feed-water is admitted
by a &ldquo;check-valve,&rdquo; the lift of which is regulated by a screw and
hand-wheel, and which when the feed-pump is not working is
kept on its seating by the boiler pressure.</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figcenter"><img style="width:737px; height:725px" src="images/img148.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 16.&mdash;Yarrow Water-tube Boiler.</td></tr></table>

<p>Every boiler is in addition supplied with a steam-gauge to
indicate the steam-pressure, with a stop-valve for regulating the
admission of steam to the steam-pipes, and with one or two safety-valves.
These last in stationary boilers usually consist of valves
kept in their seats against the steam-pressure in the boiler by
levers carrying weights, but in marine and locomotive boilers the
valves are kept closed by means of steel springs. One at least of
the safety-valves is fitted with easing gear by which it can be
lifted at any time for blowing off the steam. Blow-out cocks are
fitted for emptying the boiler.</p>

<p>Openings must always be made in boilers for access for cleaning
and examination. When these are large enough to allow a man
to enter the boiler they are termed man-holes. They are usually
made oval, as this shape permits the doors by which they are
closed to be placed on the inside so that the pressure upon them
tends to keep them shut. The doors are held in place by one or
two bolts, secured to cross-bars or &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; outside the boiler.
It is important in making these doors that they should fit the
holes so accurately that the jointing material cannot be forced
out of its proper position. In the few cases where doors are
fitted outside a boiler, so that the steam-pressure tends to
open them, they are always secured by several bolts so
that the breakage of one bolt will not allow the door to be
forced off.</p>

<p><i>Water-softening.</i>&mdash;Seeing that the impurities contained
in the feed-water are not evaporated in the steam they become
concentrated in the boiler water. Most of them become precipitated
in the boiler either in the form of mud or else as scale which
forms on the heating surfaces. Some of the mud and such of the
impurities as remain soluble may be removed by means of the
blow-off cocks, but the scale can only be removed by
periodical cleaning. Incrustations on the
heating surface not only lessen the
efficiency of the boiler by obstructing
the transmission of heat through the
plates and tubes, but if excessive they
become a source of considerable danger
by permitting the plates to become
overheated and thereby weakened. When
the feed-water is very impure, therefore,
the boilers used are those which
permit of very easy cleaning, such as
the Lancashire, Galloway and Cornish
types, to the exclusion of multitubular
or water-tube boilers in which thorough
cleaning is more difficult. In other
cases, however, the feed-water is
purified by passing it through some type
of &ldquo;softener&rdquo; before pumping it into
the boiler. Most of the impurities in
ordinary feed-water are either lime or
magnesia salts, which although soluble
in cold water are much less so in hot
water. In the &ldquo;softener&rdquo; measured
quantities of feed-water and of some
chemical reagents are thoroughly
mixed and at the same time the
temperature is raised either by exhaust
steam or by other means. Most of
the impurity is thus precipitated, and
some of the remainder is converted
into more soluble salts which remain
in solution in the boiler until blown
out. The water is filtered before being
pumped into the boiler. The quantity
and kind of chemical employed is
determined according to the nature
and amount of the impurity in the
&ldquo;hard&rdquo; feed-water.</p>

<p><i>Thermal Storage.</i>&mdash;In some cases
where the work required is very intermittent, &ldquo;thermal storage&rdquo;
is employed. Above the boiler a large cylindrical storage vessel
is placed, having sufficient capacity to contain enough feed-water
to supply the boiler throughout the periods when the maximum
output is required. The upper part of this storage vessel is
always in free communication with the steam space of the boiler,
and from the lower part of it the feed-water may be run into the
boiler when required. The feed-water is delivered into the upper
part of the vessel, and arrangements are made by which before it
falls to the bottom of the chamber it runs over very extended
surfaces exposed to the steam, its temperature being thus raised
to that of the steam. At times when less than the normal supply
of steam is required for the engine more than the average quantity
of feed-water is pumped into the chamber, and the excess
accumulates with its temperature raised to the evaporation point.
When an extra supply of steam is required, the feed-pump is
stopped and the boiler is fed with the hot water stored in the
chamber. Besides the &ldquo;storage&rdquo; effect, it is found that many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>149</span>
of the impurities of the feed become deposited in the chamber,
where they are comparatively harmless and from which they are
readily removable.</p>

<p><i>Oil Separators.</i>&mdash;When the steam from the engines is condensed
and used as feed-water, as is the case with marine boilers,
much difficulty is often experienced with the oil which passes
over with the steam. Feed-filters are employed to stop the
coarser particles of the oil, but some of the oil becomes
&ldquo;emulsified&rdquo; or suspended in the water in such extremely minute
particles that they pass through the finest filtering materials.
On the evaporation of the water in the boiler, this oil is left
as a thin film upon the heating surfaces, and by preventing the
actual contact of water with the plates has been the cause of
serious trouble. An attempt has been made to overcome the
emulsion difficulty by uniformly mixing with the water a small
quantity of solution of lime. On the water being raised in
temperature the lime is precipitated, and the minute particles
separated apparently attract the small globules of oil and become
aggregated in sufficient size to deposit themselves in quiet parts
of the boiler, whence they can be occasionally removed either
by blowing out or by cleaning. Much, however, still remains
to be done before the oil difficulty will be thoroughly removed.</p>

<p><i>Corrosion.</i>&mdash;When chemicals of any kind are used to soften
or purify feed-water it is essential that neither they nor the
products they form should have a corrosive effect upon the
boiler-plates, &amp;c. Much of the corrosion which occasionally
occurs has been traced to the action of the oxygen of the air
which enters the boiler in solution in the feed-water, and the
best practice now provides for the delivery of the feed into the
boiler at such positions that the air evolved from it as it
becomes heated passes direct to the steam space without having
an opportunity of becoming disengaged upon the under-water
surfaces of the boiler.</p>

<p>Where corrosion is feared it is usual to fit zinc slabs in the
water spaces of the boiler. Experience shows that it is better
to make them of rolled rather than of cast zinc, and to secure
them on studs which can be kept bright, so as to ensure a direct
metallic contact between the zinc and the boiler-plate. The
function of the zinc is to set up galvanic action; it plays the
part of the negative metal, and is dissolved while the metal of
the shell is kept electro-positive. Care must always be taken
that the fragments which break off the zinc as it wastes away
cannot fall upon the heating surfaces of the boiler.</p>

<tr><td class="caption1"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 18.&mdash;Handhole Fittings.</td></tr></table>

<p><i>Evaporators.</i>&mdash;In marine boilers the waste of water which
occurs from leakages in the cycle of the evaporation in the boiler,
use in the engine, condensation in the condenser and return to
the boiler as feed-water, is made up by fresh water distilled from
sea-water in &ldquo;evaporators.&rdquo; Of these there are many forms with
different provisions for cleaning the coils, but they are all
identical in principle. They are fed with sea-water, and means
are provided for blowing out the brine produced in them when
some of the water is evaporated. The heat required for the
evaporation is obtained from live
steam from the boilers, which is
admitted into coils of copper pipe.
The water condensed in these coils
is returned direct to the feed-water,
and the steam evaporated
from the sea-water is led either
into the low-pressure receiver of
the steam-engine or into the
condenser.</p>

<p><i>Efficiency of Boilers.</i>&mdash;The
useful work obtained from any boiler
depends upon many considerations.
For a high efficiency, that
is, a large amount of steam
produced in proportion to the
amount of fuel consumed, different
conditions have to be fulfilled
from those required where a large output of steam from a given
plant is of more importance than economy of fuel. For a high
efficiency, completeness of combustion of fuel must be combined
with sufficient heating surface to absorb so much of the heat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>150</span>
produced as will reduce the temperature of the funnel gases
to nearly that of steam. Completeness of combustion can
only be obtained by admitting considerably more air to the fire
than is theoretically necessary fully to oxidize the combustible
portions of the fuel, and by providing sufficient time and
opportunity for a thorough mixture of the air and furnace gases to
take place before the temperature is lowered to that critical
point below which combustion will not take place. It is generally
considered that the amount of excess air required is nearly
equal to that theoretically necessary; experience, however,
tends to show that much less than this is really required if
proper means are provided for ensuring an early complete
mixture of the gases. Different means are needed to effect this
with different kinds of coal, those necessary for properly
burning Welsh coal being altogether unsuitable for use with North
Country or Scottish coal. As all the excess air has to be raised
to the same temperature as that of the really burnt gases, it
follows that an excess of air passing through the fire lowers the
temperature in the fire and flues, and therefore lessens the heat
transmission; and as it leaves the boiler at a high temperature
it carries off some of the heat produced. A reduction of the
amount of air, therefore, may, by increasing the fire temperature
and lessening the chimney waste, actually increase the efficiency
even if at the same time it is accompanied by a slight incompleteness
of combustion.</p>

<p><i>Mechanical Stoking.</i>&mdash;Most boilers are hand-fired, a system
involving much labour and frequent openings of the furnace
doors, whereby large quantities of cold air are admitted above
the fires. Many systems of mechanical stoking have been tried,
but none has been found free from objections. That most
usually employed is known as the &ldquo;chain-grate&rdquo; stoker. In this
system, which is illustrated in fig. 13 (Woodeson boiler), the
grate consists of a wide endless chain formed of short cast-iron
bars; this passes over suitable drums at the front and back of
the boiler, by the slow rotation of which the grate travels very
slowly from front to back. The coal, which is broken small, is
fed from a hopper over the whole width of the grate, the thickness
of the fire being regulated by a door which can be raised or
lowered as desired. Thus the volatile portions of the coal are
distilled at the front of the fire, and pass over the incandescent
fuel at the back end. The speed of travel is so regulated that
by the time the remaining parts of the fuel reach the back end
the combustion is nearly complete. It will be seen that the fire
becomes thinner towards the back, and too much air is prevented
from entering the thin portion by means of vanes actuated from
the front of the boiler.</p>

<p><i>Draught.</i>&mdash;In most boilers the draught necessary for
combustion is &ldquo;natural,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> produced by a chimney. For marine
purposes, although &ldquo;natural&rdquo; draught is the more common,
many boiler installations are fitted with &ldquo;forced&rdquo; draught
arrangements. Two distinct systems are used. In that known
as the &ldquo;closed stokehold&rdquo; the stokehold compartment of the
vessel is so closed that the only exit for air from it is through
the fires. Air is driven into the stokehold by means of fans
which are made so that they can maintain an air pressure in the
stokehold above that of the outside atmosphere. This is the
system almost universally adopted in war vessels, and it is used
also in some fast passenger ships. The air pressure usually
adopted in large vessels is that corresponding to a height of from
1 to 1½ in. of water, whilst so much as 4 in. is sometimes used in
torpedo-boats and similar craft. This is, of course, in addition
to the chimney-draught due to the height of the funnel. In the
closed ashpit or Howden system, the stokehold is open, and fans
drive the air round a number of tubes, situated in the uptake,
through which the products of combustion pass on their way to
the chimney. The air thus becomes heated, and part of it is
then delivered into the ashpit below the fire and part into a
casing round the furnace front from which it enters the furnace
above the fire. In locomotive boilers the draught is produced
by the blast or the exhaust steam. With natural draught a
combustion of about 15 to 20 &#8468; of coal per sq. ft. of grate
area per hour can be obtained. With forced draught much greater
rates can be maintained, ranging from 20 &#8468; to 35 &#8468; in the
larger vessels with a moderate air pressure, to as much as 70 and
even 80 &#8468; per sq. ft. in the express types of boiler used in
torpedo boats and similar craft.</p>

<p><i>Performance of Boilers.</i>&mdash;The makers of several types of boilers
have published particulars regarding the efficiency of the boilers
they construct, but naturally these results have been obtained
under the most favourable circumstances which may not always
represent the conditions of ordinary working. The following
table of actual results of marine boiler trials, made at the instance
of the British admiralty, is particularly useful because the trials
were made with great care under working conditions, the whole
of the coal being weighed and the feed-water measured throughout
the trials by skilled observers. The various trials can be compared
amongst themselves as South Welsh coal of excellent quality was
used in all cases.</p>

<p>In experimental tests such as those above referred to, many
conditions have to be taken into account, the principal being
the duration of the trial. It is essential that the condition of the
boiler at the conclusion of the test should be precisely the same
as at the commencement, both as regards the quantity of
unconsumed coals on the fire-grate and the quantity of water and
the steam-pressure in the boiler. The longer the period over which
the observations are taken the less is the influence of errors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>151</span>
in the estimation of these particulars. Further, in order properly
to represent working conditions, the rate of combustion of the
fuel throughout the trial must be the same as that intended
to be used in ordinary working, and the duration of the test must
be sufficient to include proportionately as much cleaning of fires
as would occur under the normal working conditions. The tests
should always be made with the kind of coal intended to be
generally used, and the records should include a test of the
calorific value of a sample of the fuel carefully selected so as
fairly to represent the bulk of the coal used during the trial. The
periodic records taken are the weights of the fuel used and of
the ashes, &amp;c., produced, the temperature and quantity of the
feed-water, the steam pressure maintained, and the wetness of
the steam produced. This last should be ascertained from
samples taken from the steam pipe at a position where the
full pressure is maintained. In order to reduce to a common
standard observations taken under different conditions of feed
temperatures and steam pressures, the results are calculated
to an equivalent evaporation at the atmospheric pressure from
a feed temperature of 212° F.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">Boiler Making</p>

<p>The practice of the boiler, bridge and girder shops may here
be conveniently treated together, because similar materials and
methods are employed in each, notwithstanding that many points
of divergence in practice generally relegate them to separate
departments. The materials used are chiefly iron and steel.
The methods mostly adopted are those involved in the working
of plates and rolled sections, which vastly predominate over the
bars and rods used chiefly in the smithy. But there are numerous
differences in methods of construction. Flanging occupies a
large place in boilermaking, for end-plates, tube-plates, furnace
flues, &amp;c., but is scarcely represented in bridge and girder work.
Plates are bent to cylindrical shapes in boilermaking, for shells
and furnaces, but not in girder work. Welding is much more
common in the first than in the second, furnace flues being
always welded and stand pipes frequently. In boiler work
holes are generally drilled through the seams of adjacent plates.
In bridge work each plate or bar is usually drilled or punched
apart from its fellows. Boilers, again, being subject to high
temperatures and pressures, must be constructed with provisions
to ensure some elasticity and freedom of movement under varying
temperatures to prevent fractures or grooving, and must
be made of materials that combine high ductility with strength
when heated to furnace temperatures. Flanging of certain
parts, judicious staying, limitation of the length of the tubes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>152</span>
the forms of which are inherently weak, provide for the first;
the selection of steel or iron of high percentage elongation,
and the imposition of temper, or bending tests, both hot and cold,
provide for the second.</p>

<p>The following are the leading features of present-day methods.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It might be hastily supposed that, because plates, angles, tees,
channels and joist sections are rolled ready for use, little work
could be left for the plater and boilermaker. But actually so much
is involved that subdivisions of tasks are numerous; the operations
of templet-making, rolling, planing, punching and shearing, bending,
welding and forging, flanging, drilling, riveting, caulking, and tubing
require the labours of several groups of machine attendants, and of
gangs of unskilled labourers or helpers. Some operations also have
to be done at a red or white heat, others cold. To the first belong
flanging and welding, to the latter generally all the other operations.
Heating is necessary for the rolling of tubes of small diameter;
bending is done cold or hot according to circumstances.</p>

<p>The fact that some kinds of treatment, as shearing and punching,
flanging and bending, are of a very violent character explains why
practice has changed radically in regard to the method of performing
these operations in cases where safety is a cardinal matter. Shearing
and punching are both severely detrusive operations performed on
cold metal; both leave jagged edges and, as experience has proved,
very minute cracks, the tendency of which is to extend under subsequent
stress, with liability to produce fracture. But it has been
found that, when a shorn edge is planed and a punched hole enlarged
by reamering, no harm results, provided not less than about <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> in.
is removed. A great advance was therefore made when specifications
first insisted on the removal of the rough edges before the parts
were united.</p>

<p>In the work of riveting another evil long existed. When holes are
punched it is practically impossible to ensure the exact coincidence
of holes in different plates which have to be brought together for
the purpose of riveting. From this followed the use of the drift,&mdash;a
tapered rod driven forcibly by hammer blows through corresponding
holes in adjacent plates, by which violent treatment the holes
were forcibly drawn into alignment. This drifting stressed the plates,
setting up permanent strains and enlarging incipient cracks, and
many boiler explosions have been clearly traceable to the abuse of
this tool. Then, next, specifications insisted that all holes should be
enlarged by reamering <i>after</i> the plates were in place. But even that
did not prove a safeguard, because it often happened that the metal
reamered was nearly all removed from one side of a hole, so leaving
the other side just as the punch had torn it. Ultimately came the
era of drilling rivet-holes, to which there is no exception now in
high-class boiler work. For average girder and bridge work the practice
of punching and reamering is still in use, because the conditions of
service are not so severe as are those in steam boilers.</p>

<p>Flanging signifies the turning or bending over of the edges of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>153</span>
plate to afford a means of union to other plates. Examples occur in
the back end-plates of Lancashire and Cornish boilers, the front and
back plates of marine boilers, the fire-boxes of locomotive boilers,
the crowns of vertical boilers, the ends of conical cross-tubes, and
the Adamson seams of furnace flues. This practice has superseded
the older system of effecting union by means of rings forming two
sides of a rectangular section (angle iron rings). These were a
fruitful source of grooving and explosions in steam boilers, because
their sharp angular form lacked elasticity; hence the reason for the
substitution of a flange turned with a large radius, which afforded the
elasticity necessary to counteract the effects of changes in temperature.
In girder work where such conditions do not exist, the method of
union with angles is of course retained. In the early days of flanging
the process was performed in detail by a skilled workman (the
angle ironsmith), and it is still so done in small establishments.
A length of edge of about 10 in. or a foot is heated, and bent by
hammering around the edge of a block of iron of suitable shape.
Then another &ldquo;heat&rdquo; is taken and flanged, and another, until the
work is complete. But in modern boiler shops little hand work is
ever done; instead, plates 4 ft., 6 ft., or 8 ft. in diameter, and fire-box
plates for locomotive boilers, have their entire flanges bent at a
single squeeze between massive dies in a hydraulic press. In the case
of the ends of marine boilers which are too large for such treatment,
a special form of press bends the edges over in successive heats.
The flanges of Adamson seams are rolled over in a special machine.
A length of flue is rotated on a table, while the flange is turned
over within a minute between revolving rollers. There is another
advantage in the adoption of machine-flanging, besides the enormous
saving of time, namely, that the material suffers far less injury than
it does in hand-flanging.</p>

<p>These differences in practice would not have assumed such magnitude
but for the introduction of mild steel in place of malleable iron.
Iron suffers less from overheating and irregular heating than does
steel. Steel possesses higher ductility, but it is also more liable to
develop cracks if subjected to improper treatment. All this and much
more is writ large in the early testing of steel, and is reflected
in present-day practice.</p>

<p>A feature peculiar to the boiler and plating shops is the enormous
number of rivet holes which have to be made, and of rivets to be
inserted. These requirements are reflected in machine design. To
punch or drill holes singly is too slow a process in the best practice,
and so machines are made for producing many holes simultaneously.
Besides this, the different sections of boilers are drilled in machines
of different types, some for shells, some for furnaces, some peculiar
to the shells or furnaces of one type of boilers, others to those of
another type only. And generally now these machines not only drill,
but can also be adjusted to drill to exact pitch, the necessity
thus being avoided of marking out the holes as guides to the drills.</p>

<p>Hand-riveting has mostly been displaced by hydraulic and
pneumatic machines, with resulting great saving in cost, and the
advantage of more trustworthy and uniform results. For boiler
work, machines are mostly of fixed type; for bridge and girder work
they are portable, being slung from chains and provided with
pressure water or compressed air by systems of flexible pipes.</p>

<p>Welding fills a large place in boiler work, but it is that of the edges
of plates chiefly, predominating over that of the bars and rods of
the smithy. The edges to be united are thin and long, so that short
lengths have to be done in succession at successive &ldquo;heats.&rdquo; Much
of this is hand work, and &ldquo;gluts&rdquo; or insertion pieces are generally
preferred to overlapping joints. But in large shops, steam-driven
power hammers are used for closing the welds. Parts that are
commonly welded are the furnace flues, the conical cross-tubes and
angle rings.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the work of these departments is the immense
proportions of the modern machine tools used. This development
is due in great degree to the substitution of steel for iron. The steel
shell-plates of the largest boilers are 1½ in. thick, and these have
to be bent into cylindrical forms. In the old days of iron boilers the
capacity of rolls never exceeded about ¾ in. plate. Often, alternatively
to rolling, these thick plates are bent by squeezing them in
successive sections between huge blocks operated by hydraulic
pressure acting on toggle levers. And other machines besides the
rolls are made more massive than formerly to deal with the immense
plates of modern marine boilers.</p>

<p>The boiler and plating shops have been affected by the general
tendency to specialize manufactures. Firms have fallen into the
practice of restricting their range of product, with increase in volume.
The time has gone past when a single shop could turn out several
classes of boilers, and undertake any bridge and girder work as well.
One reason is to be found in the diminution of hand work and the
growth of the machine tool. Almost every distinct operation on
every section of a boiler or bridge may now be accomplished by one
of several highly specialized machines. Repetitive operations are
provided for thus, and by a system of templeting. If twenty or
fifty similar boilers are made in a year, each plate, hole, flange or
stay will be exactly like every similar one in the set. Dimensions of
plates will be marked from a sample or templet plate, and holes
will be marked similarly; or in many cases they are not marked
at all, but pitched and drilled at once by self-acting mechanism
embodied in drilling machines specially designed for one set of
operations on one kind of plate. Hundreds of bracing bars for bridges
and girders will be cut off all alike, and drilled or punched from a
templet bar, so that they are ready to take their place in bridge or
girder without any adjustments or fitting.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOILING TO DEATH,<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> a punishment once common both in
England and on the continent. The only extant legislative
notice of it in England occurs in an act passed in 1531 during
the reign of Henry VIII., providing that convicted poisoners
should be boiled to death; it is, however, frequently mentioned
earlier as a punishment for coining. The <i>Chronicles of the
Grey Friars</i> (published by the Camden Society, 1852) have an
account of boiling for poisoning at Smithfield in the year 1522,
the man being fastened to a chain and lowered into boiling
water several times until he died. The preamble of the statute
of Henry VIII. (which made poisoning treason) in 1531 recites
that one Richard Roose (or Coke), a cook, by putting poison
in some food intended for the household of the bishop of Rochester
and for the poor of the parish of Lambeth, killed a man
and woman. He was found guilty of treason and sentenced to
be boiled to death without benefit of clergy. He was publicly
boiled at Smithfield. In the same year a maid-servant for
poisoning her mistress was boiled at King&rsquo;s Lynn. In 1542 Margaret
Davy, a servant, for poisoning her employer, was boiled at
Smithfield. In the reign of Edward VI., in 1547, the act was
repealed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOISÉ,<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Ada county, Idaho,
U.S.A., and the capital of the state, situated on the N. side of
the Boisé river, in the S.W. part of the state, at an altitude of
about 2700 ft. Pop. (1890) 2311; (1900) 5957; (1910) 17,358.
It is served by the Oregon Short Line railway, being the terminus
of a branch connecting with the main line at Nampa, about 20 m. W.;
and by electric lines connecting with Caldwell and Nampa.
The principal buildings are the state capitol, the United States
assay office, a Carnegie library, a natatorium, and the Federal
building, containing the post office, the United States circuit
and district court rooms, and a U.S. land office. Boisé is the
seat of the state school for the deaf and blind (1906), and just
outside the city limits are the state soldiers&rsquo; home and the state
penitentiary. About 2 m. from the city are Federal barracks.
Hot water (175° F.) from artesian wells near the city is utilized
for the natatorium and to heat many residences and public
buildings. The Boisé valley is an excellent country for raising
apples, prunes and other fruits. The manufactured products of the
city are such as are demanded by a mining country, principally
lumber, flour and machine-shop products. Boisé is the trade
centre of the surrounding fruit-growing, agricultural and mining
country, and is an important wool market. The oldest settlement
in the vicinity was made by the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Fur Company on the
west side of the Boisé river, before 1860; the present city,
chartered in 1864, dates from 1863. After 1900 the city grew very
rapidly, principally owing to the great irrigation schemes in
southern Idaho; the water for the immense Boisé-Payette irrigation
system is taken from the Boisé, 8 m. above the city. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Idaho</a></span>.)</p>

(Manche) on the 11th of September 1824. He served in the
army pay department in Algeria from 1844 to 1848, and extended
his travels to the East. He made his literary debut in the <i>Petit
journal</i> with a story entitled <i>Deux comédiens</i> (1868). With
<i>Le Forçat colonel</i> (1872) he became one of the most popular
feuilleton writers. His police stories, though not so convincing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>154</span>
as those of Émile Gaboriau, with whom his name is generally
associated, had a great circulation, and many of them have been
translated into English. Among his stories may be mentioned:

<p><span class="bold">BOISGUILBERT, PIERRE LE PESANT,<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> <span class="sc">Sieur de</span> (1676-1714),
French economist, was born at Rouen of an ancient noble
family of Normandy, allied to that of Corneille. He received
his classical education in Rouen, entered the magistracy and
became judge at Montivilliers, near Havre. In 1690 he became
president of the <i>bailliage</i> of Rouen, a post which he retained
almost until his death, leaving it to his son. In these two
situations he made a close study of local economic conditions,
personally supervising the cultivation of his lands, and entering
into relations with the principal merchants of Rouen. He was
thus led to consider the misery of the people under the burden
of taxation. In 1695 he published his principal work, <i>Le Détail
de la France; la cause de la diminution de ses biens, et la facilité
du remède</i>.... In it he drew a picture of the general ruin
of all classes of Frenchmen, caused by the bad economic régime.
In opposition to Colbert&rsquo;s views he held that the wealth of a
country consists, not in the abundance of money which it possesses
but in what it produces and exchanges. The remedy for the
evils of the time was not so much the reduction as the equalization
of the imposts, which would allow the poor to consume
more, raise the production and add to the general wealth. He
demanded the reform of the <i>taille</i>, the suppression of internal
customs duties and greater freedom of trade. In his <i>Factum
de la France</i>, published in 1705 or 1706, he gave a more concise
<i>résumé</i> of his ideas. But his proposal to substitute for all aides
and customs duties a single capitation tax of a tenth of the
revenue of all property was naturally opposed by the farmers
of taxes and found little support. Indeed his work, written in
a diffuse and inelegant style, passed almost unnoticed. Saint
Simon relates that he once asked a hearing of the comte de
Pontchartrain, saying that he would at first believe him mad,
then become interested, and then see he was right. Pontchartrain
bluntly told him that he did think him mad, and turned
his back on him. With Michel de Chamillart, whom he had
known as intendant of Rouen (1689-1690), he had no better
success. Upon the disgrace of Vauban, whose <i>Dîme royale</i>
had much in common with Boisguilbert&rsquo;s plan, Boisguilbert
violently attacked the controller in a pamphlet, <i>Supplément
au détail de la France</i>. The book was seized and condemned,
and its author exiled to Auvergne, though soon allowed to
return. At last in 1710 the controller-general, Nicolas Desmarets,
established a new impost, the &ldquo;tenth&rdquo; (<i>dixième</i>),
which had some analogy with the project of Boisguilbert.
Instead of replacing the former imposts, however, Desmarets
simply added his <i>dixième</i> to them; the experiment was naturally
disastrous, and the idea was abandoned.</p>

<p>In 1712 appeared a <i>Testament politique de M. de Vauban</i>, which is
simply Boisguilbert&rsquo;s <i>Détail de la France</i>. Vauban&rsquo;s <i>Dîme royale</i>

<p><span class="bold">BOISROBERT, FRANÇOIS LE METEL DE<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> (1592-1662),
French poet, was born at Caen in 1592. He was trained for the
law, and practised for some time at the bar at Rouen. About
1622 he went to Paris, and by the next year had established a
footing at court, for he had a share in the ballet of the <i>Bacchanales</i>
performed at the Louvre in February. He accompanied an embassy
to England in 1625, and in 1630 visited Rome, where he won
the favour of Urban VIII. by his wit. He took orders, and was
made a canon of Rouen. He had been introduced to Richelieu
in 1623, and by his humour and his talent as a raconteur
soon made himself indispensable to the cardinal. Boisrobert
became one of the five poets who carried out Richelieu&rsquo;s dramatic
ideas. He had a passion for play, and was a friend of Ninon de
l&rsquo;Enclos; and his enemies found ready weapons against him
in the undisguised looseness of his life. He was more than once
disgraced, but never for long, although in his later years he was
compelled to give more attention to his duties as a priest. It
was Boisrobert who suggested to Richelieu the plan of the Academy,
and he was one of its earliest and most active members.
Rich as he was through the benefices conferred on him by his
patron, he was liberal to men of letters. After the death of
Richelieu, he attached himself to Mazarin, whom he served
faithfully throughout the Fronde. He died on the 30th of
March 1662. He wrote a number of comedies, to one of which,
<i>La Belle Plaideuse</i>, Molière&rsquo;s <i>L&rsquo;Avare</i> is said to owe something;
and also some volumes of verse. The licentious <i>Contes</i>, published
under the name of his brother D&rsquo;Ouville, are often attributed to
him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOISSARD, JEAN JACQUES<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> (1528-1602), French antiquary
and Latin poet, was born at Besançon. He studied at Louvain;
but, disgusted by the severity of his master, he secretly left
that seminary, and after traversing a great part of Germany
reached Italy, where he remained several years and was often
reduced to great straits. His residence in Italy developed in
his mind a taste for antiquities, and he soon formed a collection
of the most curious monuments from Rome and its vicinity. He
then visited the islands of the Archipelago, with the intention
of travelling through Greece, but a severe illness obliged him to
return to Rome. Here he resumed his favourite pursuits with
great ardour, and having completed his collection, returned to his
native country; but not being permitted to profess publicly
the Protestant religion, which he had embraced some time before,
he withdrew to Metz, where he died on the 30th of October 1602.
His most important works are: <i>Poemata</i> (1574); <i>Emblemata</i>
(1584); <i>Icones Virorum Illustrium</i> (1597); <i>Vitae et Icones
Sultanorum Turcicorum</i>, &amp;c. (1597); <i>Theatrum Vitae Humanae</i>

<p><span class="bold">BOISSIER, MARIE LOUIS ANTOINE GASTON<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> (1823-1908),
French classical scholar, and secretary of the French Academy,
was born at Nimes on the 15th of August 1823. The Roman
monuments of his native town very early attracted Gaston
Boissier to the study of ancient history. He made epigraphy
his particular theme, and at the age of twenty-three became a
professor of rhetoric at Angoulême, where he lived and worked
for ten years without further ambition. A travelling inspector
of the university, however, happened to hear him lecture, and
Boissier was called to Paris to be professor at the Lycée Charlemagne.
He began his literary career by a thesis on the poet
Attius (1857) and a study on the life and work of M. Terentius
Varro (1861). In 1861 he was made professor of Latin oratory at
the Collège de France, and he became an active contributor to
the <i>Revue des deux mondes</i>. In 1865 he published <i>Cicéron
et ses amis</i> (Eng. trans, by A.D. Jones, 1897), which has enjoyed
a success such as rarely falls to the lot of a work of erudition.
In studying the manners of ancient Rome, Boissier had learned to
re-create its society and to reproduce its characteristics with
exquisite vivacity. In 1874 he published <i>La Religion romaine
d&rsquo;Auguste aux Antonins</i> (2 vols.), in which he analysed the
great religious movement of antiquity that preceded the acceptance
of Christianity. In <i>L&rsquo;Opposition sous les Césars</i> (1875) he
drew a remarkable picture of the political decadence of Rome
under the early successors of Augustus. By this time Boissier
had drawn to himself the universal respect of scholars and men of
letters, and on the death of H.J.G. Patin, the author of <i>Études
sur les tragiques grecs</i>, in 1876, he was elected a member of the
French Academy, of which he was appointed perpetual secretary
in 1895.</p>

<p>His later works include <i>Promenades archéologiques: Rome
et Pompéi</i> (1880; second series, 1886); <i>L&rsquo;Afrique romaine,
promenades archéologiques</i> (1901); <i>La Fin du paganisme</i> (2 vols.,
1891); <i>Le Conjuration de Catilina</i> (1905); <i>Tacite</i> (1903, Eng.

example of the French talent for lucidity and elegance applied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>155</span>
with entire seriousness to weighty matters of literature. Though
he devoted himself mainly to his great theme, the reconstruction
of the elements of Roman society, he also wrote monographs
on <i>Madame de Sévigné</i> (1887) and <i>Saint-Simon</i> (1892). He
died in June 1908.</p>

administration of General Dumouriez. Driven from it in 1795,
he was restored by Lucien Bonaparte, during whose time of
office he served as secretary to the prefecture of the Upper Marne.
He then definitely resigned public employment and devoted himself
to the study of Greek. In 1809 he was appointed deputy
professor of Greek at the faculty of letters at Paris, and titular
professor in 1813 on the death of P.H. Larcher. In 1828 he
succeeded J.B. Gail in the chair of Greek at the Collège de
France. He also held the offices of librarian of the Bibliothèque
du Roi, and of perpetual secretary of the Académie des Inscriptions.
He died on the 8th of September 1857. Boissonade
chiefly devoted his attention to later Greek literature: Philostratus,
<i>Heroica</i> (1806) and <i>Epistolae</i> (1842); Marinus, <i>Vita

<p><span class="bold">BOISSY D&rsquo;ANGLAS, FRANÇOIS ANTOINE DE<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> (1756-1828),
French statesman, received a careful education and busied
himself at first with literature. He had been a member of several
provincial academies before coming to Paris, where he purchased
a position as advocate to the parlement. In 1789 he was elected
by the third estate of the <i>sénéchaussée</i> of Annonay as deputy
to the states-general. He was one of those who induced the
states-general to proclaim itself a National Assembly on the 17th
of June 1789; approved, in several speeches, of the capture of
the Bastille and of the taking of the royal family to Paris (October
1789); demanded that strict measures be taken against the
royalists who were intriguing in the south of France, and published
some pamphlets on finance. During the Legislative Assembly
he was <i>procureur-syndic</i> for the directory of the department
of Ardeche. Elected to the Convention, he sat in the centre,
&ldquo;<i>le Marais</i>,&rdquo; voting in the trial of Louis XVI. for his detention
until deportation should be judged expedient for the state. He
was then sent on a mission to Lyons to investigate the frauds in
connexion with the supplies of the army of the Alps. During
the Terror he was one of those deputies of the centre who supported
Robespierre; but he was gained over by the members
of the Mountain hostile to Robespierre, and his support, along
with that of some other leaders of the <i>Marais</i>, made possible the
9th Thermidor. He was then elected a member of the Committee
of Public Safety and charged with the superintendence of the provisioning
of Paris. He presented the report supporting the decree
of the 3rd Ventose of the year III. which established liberty of
worship. In the critical days of Germinal and of Prairial of the
year III. he showed great courage. On the 12th Germinal
he was in the tribune, reading a report on the food supplies,
when the hall of the Convention was invaded by the rioters, and
when they withdrew he quietly continued where he had been
interrupted. On the 1st Prairial he presided over the Convention,
and remained unmoved by the insults and menaces of
the insurgents. When the head of the deputy, Jean Féraud, was
presented to him on the end of a pike, he saluted it impassively.
He was reporter of the committee which drew up the constitution
of the year III., and his report shows keen apprehension
of a return of the Reign of Terror, and presents reactionary
measures as precautions against the re-establishment of &ldquo;tyranny
and anarchy.&rdquo; This report, the proposal that he made
(August 27, 1795) to lessen the severity of the revolutionary
laws, and the eulogies he received from several Paris sections
suspected of disloyalty to the republic, resulted in his being
obliged to justify himself (October 15, 1795). As a member
of the Council of the Five Hundred he became more and more
suspected of royalism. He presented a measure in favour of
full liberty for the press, which at that time was almost
unanimously reactionary, protested against the outlawry of returned
<i>émigrés</i>, spoke in favour of the deported priests and attacked
the Directory. Accordingly he was proscribed on the 18th
Fructidor, and lived in England until the Consulate. In 1801
he was made a member of the Tribunate, and in 1805 a senator.
In 1814 he voted for Napoleon&rsquo;s abdication, which won for him
a seat in the chamber of peers; but during the Hundred Days he
served Napoleon, and in consequence, on the second Restoration,
was for a short while excluded. In the chamber he still sought
to obtain liberty for the press&mdash;a theme upon which he published
a volume of his speeches (Paris, 1817). He was a member of the
Institute from its foundation, and in 1816, at the reorganization,
became a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et
Belles-Lettres. He published in 1819-1821 a two-volume <i>Essai
sur la vie et les opinions de M. de Malesherbes</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOITO, ARRIGO<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> (1842-&emsp;&emsp;), Italian poet and musical
composer, was born at Padua on the 24th of February 1842.
He studied music at the Milan Conservatoire, but even in those
early days he devoted as much of his time to literature as to
music, forecasting the divided allegiance which was to be the
chief characteristic of his life&rsquo;s history. While at the Conservatoire
he wrote and composed, in collaboration with Franco Faccio,
a cantata, <i>Le Sorelle d&rsquo;Italia</i>, which was performed with success.
On completing his studies Boito travelled for some years, and
after his return to Italy settled down in Milan, dividing his
time between journalism and music. In 1866 he fought under
Garibaldi, and in 1868 conducted the first performance of his
opera <i>Mefistofele</i> at the Scala theatre, Milan. The work
failed completely, and was withdrawn after a second performance.
It was revived in 1875 at Bologna in a much altered and
abbreviated form, when its success was beyond question. It was
performed in London in 1880 with success, but in spite of frequent
revivals has never succeeded in firmly establishing itself in
popular favour. Boito treated the Faust legend in a spirit far more
nearly akin to the conception of Goethe than is found in Gounod&rsquo;s
Faust, but, in spite of many isolated beauties, his opera lacks
cohesion and dramatic interest. His energies were afterwards chiefly
devoted to the composition of libretti, of which the principal are
<i>Otello</i> and <i>Falstaff</i>, set to music by Verdi;
<i>La Gioconda</i>, set by Ponchielli; <i>Amleto</i>, set by Faccio;
and <i>Ero e Leandre</i>, set by Bottesini and Mancinelli. These works
display a rare knowledge of the requirements of dramatic poetry,
together with uncommon literary value. Boito also published
a book of poems and a novel, <i>L&rsquo;Alfier Meno</i>. The degree of
doctor of music was conferred upon him in 1893 by the university
of Cambridge.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOIVIN, FRANÇOIS DE,<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> Baron de Villars (d. 1618), French
chronicler, entered the service of Charles, Marshal Brissac, as
secretary, and accompanied him to Piedmont in 1550 when the
marshal went to take command of the French troops in the war
with Spain. Remaining in this service he was sent after the
defeat of the French at St Quentin in 1557 to assure the French
king Henry II. of the support of Brissac. He took part in the
negotiations which led to the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis in
April 1559, but was unable to prevent Henry II. from ceding
the conquests made by Brissac. Boivin wrote <i>Mémoires sur les
guerres démêlées tant dans le Piémont qu&rsquo;au Montferrat et duche
de Milan par Charles de Cossé, comte de Brissac</i> (Paris, 1607),
which, in spite of some drawbacks, is valuable as the testimony
of an eye-witness of the war. An edition, carefully revised,

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOKENAM, OSBERN<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> (1393?-1447?), English author, was born,
by his own account, on the 6th of October 1393. Dr Horstmann
suggests that he may have been a native of Bokeham, now
Bookham, in Surrey, and derived his name from the place.
In a concluding note to his <i>Lives of the Saints</i> he is described
as &ldquo;a Suffolke man, frere Austyn of Stoke Clare.&rdquo; He travelled
in Italy on at least two occasions, and in 1445 was a pilgrim to
Santiago de Compostela. He wrote a series of thirteen legends
of holy maidens and women. These are written chiefly in seven-
and eight-lined stanzas, and nine of them are preceded by
prologues. Bokenam was a follower of Chaucer and Lydgate,
and doubtless had in mind Chaucer&rsquo;s <i>Legend of Good Women</i>.
His chief, but by no means his only, source was the <i>Legenda
Aurea</i> of Jacobus de Voragine, archbishop of Genoa, whom he cites
as &ldquo;Januence.&rdquo; The first of the legends, <i>Vita Scae Margaretae,
virginis et martiris</i>, was written for his friend, Thomas Burgh,
a Cambridge monk; others are dedicated to pious ladies who
desired the history of their name-saints. The Arundel MS. 327
(British Museum) is a unique copy of Bokenam&rsquo;s work; it was
finished, according to the concluding note, in 1447, and
presented by the scribe, Thomas Burgh, to a convent unnamed
&ldquo;that the nuns may remember him and his sister, Dame Betrice
Burgh.&rdquo; The poems were edited (1835) for the Roxburghe Club
with the title <i>Lyvys of Seyntys</i> ..., and by Dr Carl Horstmann
as <i>Osbern Bokenams Legenden</i> (Heilbronn, 1883), in E. Kölbing&rsquo;s
<i>Altengl. Bibliothek</i>, vol. i. Both editions include a dialogue
written in Latin and English taken from Dugdale&rsquo;s <i>Monasticon
Anglicanum</i> (ed. 1846, vol. vi. p. 1600); &ldquo;this dialogue betwixt
a Secular asking and a Frere answerynge at the grave of Dame
Johan of Acres shewith the lyneal descent of the lordis of the
honoure of Clare fro ... MCCXLVIII to ... MCCCLVI&rdquo;.
Bokenam wrote, as he tells us, plainly, in the Suffolk speech.
He explains his lack of decoration on the plea that the finest
flowers had been already plucked by Chaucer, Gower and Lydgate.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOKHARA,<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Bukhara</span> (the common central Asian pronunciation
is Bukhara), a state of central Asia, under the protection
of Russia. It lies on the right bank of the middle Oxus,
between 37° and 41° N., and between 62° and 72° E., and is
bounded by the Russian governments of Syr-darya, Samarkand
and Ferghana on the N., the Pamirs on the E., Afghanistan on
the S., and the Transcaspian territory and Khiva on the W.
Its south-eastern frontier on the Pamirs is undetermined except
where it touches the Russian dominions. Including the khanates
of Karateghin and Darvaz the area is about 85,000 sq. m. The
western portion of the state is a plain watered by the Zarafshan
and by countless irrigation canals drawn from it. It has in the
east the Karnap-chul steppe, covered with grass in early summer,
and in the north an intrusion of the Kara-kum sand desert.
Land suitable for cultivation is found only in oases, where it is
watered by irrigation canals, but these oases are very fertile.
The middle portion of the state is occupied by high plateaus,
about 4000 ft. in altitude, sloping from the Tian-shan, and
intersected by numerous rivers, flowing towards the Oxus. This
region, very fertile in the valleys and enjoying a cooler and damper
climate than the lower plains, is densely populated, and agriculture
and cattle-breeding are carried on extensively. Here are
the towns of Karshi, Kitab, Shaar, Chirakchi and Guzar or
Huzar. The Hissar range, a westward continuation of the Alai
Mountains, separates the Zarafshan from the tributaries of
the Oxus&mdash;the Surkhan, Kafirnihan and Vakhsh. Its length is
about 200 m., and its passes, 1000 to 3000 ft. below the surrounding
peaks, reach altitudes of 12,000 to 14,000 ft. and are extremely
difficult. Numbers of rivers pierce or flow in wild gorges between
its spurs. Its southern foot-hills, covered with loess, make the
fertile valleys of Hissar and the Vakhsh. The climate is so dry,
and the rains are so scarce, that an absence of forests and Alpine
meadows is characteristic of the ridge; but when heavy rain
falls simultaneously with the melting of the snows in the mountains,
the watercourses become filled with furious torrents, which
create great havoc. The main glaciers (12) are on the north slope,
but none creeps below 10,000 to 12,000 ft. The Peter the Great
range, or Periokh-tau, in Karateghin, south of the valley of the
Vakhsh, runs west-south-west to east-north-east for about 130 m.,
and is higher than the Hissar range. From the meridian of Garm
or Harm it rises above the snowline, attaining at least 18,000 ft.
in the Sary-kaudal peak, and 20,000 ft. farther east where it
joins the snow-clad Darvaz range, and where the group Sandal,
adorned with several glaciers, rises to 24,000 or 25,000 ft. Only
three passes, very difficult, are known across it.</p>

<p>Darvaz, a small vassal state of Bokhara, is situated on the
Panj, where it makes its sharp bend westwards, and is emphatically
a mountainous region, agriculture being possible only in
the lower parts of the valleys. The population, about 35,000,
consists chiefly of Moslem Tajiks, and the closely-related Galchas,
and its chief town is Kala-i-khumb on the Panj, at an altitude
of 4370 ft.</p>

<p>The chief river of Bokhara is the Oxus or Amu-darya, which
separates it from Afghanistan on the south, and then flows along
its south-west border. It is navigated from the mouth of the
Surkhan, and steamboats ply on it up to Karki near the Afghan
frontier. The next largest river, the Zarafshan, 660 m. long,
the water of which is largely utilized for irrigation, is lost in the
sands 20 m. before reaching the Oxus. The Kashka-darya,
which flows westwards out of the glaciers of Hazret-sultan (west
of the Hissar range), supplies the Shahri-sabs (properly Shaar-sabiz)
oasis with water, but is lost in the desert to the west of
Karshi.</p>

<p>The climate of Bokhara is extreme. In the lowlands a very
hot summer is followed by a short but cold winter, during which
a frost of -20° Fahr. may set in, and the Oxus may freeze for a
fortnight. In the highlands this hot and dry summer is followed
by four months of winter; and, finally, in the regions above
8000 ft. there is a great development of snowfields and glaciers,
the passes are buried under snow, and the short summer is rainy.
The lowlands are sometimes visited by terrible sand-storms from
the west, which exhaust men and kill the cotton trees. Malaria
is widely prevalent, and in some years, after a wet spring, assumes
a malignant character.</p>

<p>The population is estimated at 1,250,000. The dominant race
is the Uzbegs, who are fanatical Moslem Sunnites, scorn work,
despise their Iranian subjects, and maintain their old division
into tribes or clans. The nomad Turkomans and the nomad
Kirghiz are also of Turkish origin; while the Sarts, who constitute
the bulk of the population in the towns, are a mixture of Turks
with Iranians. The great bulk of the population in the country
is composed of Iranian Tajiks, who differ but very little from
Sarts. Besides these there are Afghans, Persians, Jews, Arabs
and Armenians. Much of the trade is in the hands of a colony
of Hindus from Shikarpur. Nearly 20% of the population are
nomads and about 15% semi-nomads.</p>

<p>On the irrigated lowlands rice, wheat and other cereals are
cultivated, and exported to the highlands. Cotton is widely
grown and exported. Silk is largely produced, and tobacco,
wine, flax, hemp and fruits are cultivated. Cattle-breeding
is vigorously prosecuted in Hissar and the highlands generally.
Cotton, silks, woollen cloth, and felt are manufactured, also
boots, saddles, cutlery and weapons, pottery and various oils.
Salt, as also some iron and copper, and small quantities of gold
are extracted. Trade has been greatly promoted by the building
of the Transcaspian railway across the country (from Charjui on
the Oxus to Kati-kurgan) in 1886-1888. The exports to Russia
consist of raw cotton and silk, lamb-skins, fruits and carpets,
and the imports of manufactured goods and sugar. The imports
from India are cottons, tea, shawls and indigo. There are very
few roads; goods are transported on camels, or on horses and
donkeys in the hilly tracts.</p>

<p>Bokhara has for ages been looked upon as the centre of
Mussulman erudition in central Asia. About one-fourth of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>157</span>
population is said to be able to read and write. The primary
schools are numerous in the capital, as well as in the other cities,
and even exist in villages, and <i>madrasas</i> or theological seminaries
for higher courses of study are comparatively plentiful. The
<i>mullahs</i> or priests enjoy very great influence, but the people are
very superstitious, believing in witchcraft, omens, spirits and
the evil eye. Women occupy a low position in the social scale,
though slavery has been abolished at the instance of Russia.
The emir of Bokhara is an autocratic ruler, his power being
limited only by the traditional custom (<i>sheriat</i>) of the Mussulmans.
He maintains an army of some 11,000 men, but is
subject to Russian control, being in fact a vassal of that empire.</p>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;Bokhara was known to the ancients under the name
of Sogdiana. It was too far removed to the east ever to be
brought under the dominion of Rome, but it has shared deeply
in all the various and bloody revolutions of Asia. The foundation
of the capital is ascribed to Efrasiab, the great Persian hero.
After the conquests of Alexander the Great Sogdiana formed
part of the empire of the Seleucidae, and shared the fortunes of
the rather better-known Bactria. Somewhat later the nomad
Yue-chi began to move into the valley of the Oxus from the east,
and gradually became a settled territorial power in Bactria and
Sogdiana, and the dominions of their king, Kadphises I. (who is
believed to have come to the throne about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 45), extended
from Bokhara to the Indus. The district, however, was reconquered
by Persia under the Sassanian dynasty, and we hear
of Nestorian Christians at Samarkand, at any rate in the 6th
century. Islam was introduced shortly after the Arab conquest
of Persia (640-642) and speedily became the dominant faith.
In the early centuries of Mahommedan rule Sogdiana was one of
the most celebrated and flourishing districts of central Asia.
It was called Sughd, and contained the two great cities of
Samarkand and Bokhara, of which the former was generally the
seat of government, while the latter had a high reputation as a
seat of religion and learning. During the early middle ages this
legion was also known as Ma wara &rsquo;l Nahr or Ma-vera-un-nahr,
the meaning of which is given in the alternative classical title
of Transoxiana. Malik Shah, third of the Seljuk dynasty of
Persia, passed the Oxus about the end of the 11th century, and
subdued the whole country watered by that river and the
Jaxartes. In 1216 Bokhara was again subdued by Mahommed
Shah Khwarizm, but his conquest was wrested from him by
Jenghiz Khan in 1220. The country was wasted by the fury of
this savage conqueror, but recovered something of its former
prosperity under Ogdai Khan, his son, whose disposition was
humane and benevolent. His posterity kept possession till 1369,
when Timur or Tamerlane bore down everything before him, and
established his capital at Samarkand, which with Bokhara
regained for a time its former splendour. Babar, the fifth in
descent from Timur, was originally prince of Ferghana, but
conquered Samarkand and northern India, where he founded
the Mogul (Mughal) empire. His descendants ruled in the
country until about 1500, when it was overrun by the Uzbeg
Tatars, under Abulkhair or Ebulkheir Khan, the founder of
the Shaibani dynasty, with which the history of Bokhara
properly commences. The most remarkable representative of
this family was Abdullah Khan (1556-1598), who greatly
extended the limits of his kingdom by the conquest of Badakshan,
Herat and Meshhed, and increased its prosperity by the public
works which he authorized. Before the close of the century,
however, the dynasty was extinct, and Bokhara was at once
desolated by a Kirghiz invasion and distracted by a disputed
succession. At length, in 1598, Baki Mehemet Khan, of the
Astrakhan branch of the Timur family, mounted the throne,
and thus introduced the dynasty of the Ashtarkhanides. The
principal event of his reign was the defeat he inflicted on Shah
Abbas of Persia in the neighbourhood of Balkh. His brother
Vali Mehemet, who succeeded in 1605, soon alienated his subjects,
and was supplanted by his nephew Imamkuli. After a highly
prosperous reign this prince resigned in favour of his brother,
Nazr Mehemet, under whom the country was greatly troubled
by the rebellion of his sons, who continued to quarrel with each
other after their father&rsquo;s death. Meanwhile the district of Khiva,
previously subject to Bokhara, was made an independent
khanate by Abdul-Gazi Bahadur Khan; and in the reign of
Subhankuli, who ascended the throne in 1680, the political
power of Bokhara was still further lessened, though it continued
to enjoy the unbounded respect of the Sunnite Mahommedans.
Subhankuli died in 1702, and a war of succession broke out
between his two sons, who were supported by the rivalry of two
Uzbeg tribes. After five years the contest terminated in favour
of Obeidullah, who was little better than a puppet in the hands
of Rehim Bi Atalik, his vizier. The invasion of Nadir Shah of
Persia came to complete the degradation of the land; and in 1740
the feeble king, Abu &rsquo;l-Faiz, paid homage to the conqueror, and
was soon after murdered and supplanted by his vizier. The
time of the Ashtarkhanides had been for the most part a time of
dissolution and decay; fanaticism and imbecility went hand in
hand. On its fall (1785) the throne was seized by the Manghit
family in the person of Mir Ma&rsquo;sum, who pretended to the most
extravagant sanctity, and proved by his military career that he
had no small amount of ability. He turned his attention to the
encroachments of the Afghans, and in 1781 reconquered the
greater part of what had been lost to the south of the Oxus.
Dying in 1802 he was succeeded by Saïd, who in bigotry and
fanaticism was a true son of his father. In 1826 Nasrullah
mounted the throne, and began with the murder of his brother
a reign of continued oppression and cruelty. Meanwhile Bokhara
became an object of rivalry to Russia and England, and envoys
were sent by both nations to cultivate the favour of the emir,
who treated the Russians with arrogance and the English with
contempt. Two emissaries of the British government, Colonel
C. Stoddart and Captain A. Conolly, were thrown by Nasrullah
into prison, where they were put to death in 1842. In 1862-1864
Arminius Vambéry made in the disguise of a dervish a memorable
journey through this fanatical state. At this time the Russian
armies were gradually advancing, and at last they appeared in
Khokand; but the new emir, Mozaffer-eddin, instead of attempting
to expiate the insults of his predecessor, sent a letter to
General M.G. Chernayev summoning him to evacuate the
country, and threatening to raise all the faithful against him.
In 1866 the Russians invaded the territory of Bokhara proper,
and a decisive battle was fought on the 20th of May at Irdjar
on the left bank of the Jaxartes. The Bokharians were defeated;
but after a period of reluctant peace they forced the emir to
renew the war. In 1868 the Russians entered Samarkand (May
14), and the emir was constrained to submit to the terms of the
conqueror, becoming henceforward only a Russian puppet.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOKHARA<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> (Bokkara-i-Sherif), capital of the state of Bokhara,
on the left bank of the Zarafshan, and on the irrigation canal of
Shahri-rud, situated in a fertile plain. It is 8 m. from the
Bokhara station of the Transcaspian railway, 162 m. by rail
W. of Samarkand, in 39° 47&prime; N. lat. and 64° 27&prime; E. long. The
city is surrounded by a stone wall 28 ft. high and 8 m. long, with
semicircular towers and eleven gates of little value as a defence.
The present city was begun in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 830 on the site of an older
city, was destroyed by Jenghiz Khan in 1220, and rebuilt subsequently.
The water-supply is very unhealthy. The city has
no less than 360 mosques. Nearly 10,000 pupils are said to
receive their education in its 140 <i>madrasas</i> or theological colleges;
primary schools are kept at most mosques. Some of these
buildings exhibit very fine architecture. The most notable of
the mosques is the Mir-Arab, built in the 16th century, with
its beautiful lecture halls; the chief mosque of the emir is the
Mejid-kalyan, or Kok-humbez, close by which stands a brick
minaret, 203 ft. high, from the top of which state criminals used
to be thrown until 1871. Of the numerous squares the Raghistan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span>
is the principal. It has on one side the citadel, erected on an
artificially made eminence 45 ft. high, surrounded by a wall
1 m. long, and containing the palace of the emir, the houses of
the chief functionaries, the prison and the water-cisterns. The
houses are mostly one-storeyed, built of unburned bricks, and
have flat roofs.</p>

<p>Bokhara has for ages been a centre of learning and religious
life. The mysticism which took hold on Persia in the middle
ages spread also to Bokhara, and later, when the Mongol invasions
of the 13th century laid waste Samarkand and other Moslem
cities, Bokhara, remaining independent, continued to be a chief
seat of Islamitic learning. The <i>madrasa</i> libraries, some of which
were very rich, have been scattered and lost, or confiscated by
the emirs, or have perished in conflagrations. But there are
still treasures of literature concealed in private libraries, and
Afghan, Persian, Armenian and Turkish bibliophiles still
repair to Bokhara to buy rare books. Bokhara is, in fact, the
principal book-market of central Asia. The population is
supposed by Russian travellers not to exceed 50,000 or 60,000,
but is otherwise estimated at 75,000 to 100,000. Amongst them
is a large and ancient colony of Jews. Bokhara is the most
important trading town in central Asia. In the city bazaars
are made or sold silk stuffs, metal (especially copper) wares,
Kara-kul (<i>i.e.</i> astrakhan) lamb-skins and carpets.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLAN PASS,<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> an important pass on the Baluch frontier,
connecting Jacobabad and Sibi with Quetta, which has always
occupied an important place in the history of British campaigns
in Afghanistan. Since the treaty of Gandamak, which was
signed at the close of the first phase of the Afghan War in 1879,
the Bolan route has been brought directly under British control,
and it was selected for the first alignment of the Sind-Pishin
railway from the plains to the plateau. From Sibi the line runs
south-west, skirting the hills to Rindli, and originally followed
the course of the Bolan stream to its head on the plateau. The
destructive action of floods, however, led to the abandonment
of this alignment, and the railway now follows the Mashkaf
valley (which debouches into the plains close to Sibi), and is
carried from near the head of the Mashkaf to a junction with the
Bolan at Mach. An alternative route from Sibi to Quetta was
found in the Harnai valley to the N.E. of Sibi, the line starting
in exactly the opposite direction to that of the Bolan and entering
the hills at Nari. The Harnai route, although longer, is the one
adopted for all ordinary traffic, the Bolan loop being reserved
for emergencies. At the Khundilani gorge of the Bolan route
conglomerate cliffs enclose the valley rising to a height of 800 ft.,
and at Sir-i-Bolan the passage between the limestone rocks
hardly admits of three persons riding abreast. The temperature
of the pass in summer is very high, whereas in winter,
near its head, the cold is extreme, and the ice-cold wind rushing
down the narrow outlet becomes destructive to life. Since
1877, when the Quetta agency was founded, the freedom of
the pass from plundering bands of Baluch marauders (chiefly
Marris) has been secured, and it is now as safe as any pass in
Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLAS<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> (plural of Span, <i>bola</i>, ball), a South American Indian
weapon of war and the chase, consisting of balls of stone attached
to the ends of a rope of twisted or braided hide or hemp. Charles
Darwin thus describes them in his <i>Voyage of the Beagle</i>: &ldquo;The
<i>bolas</i>, or balls, are of two kinds: the simplest, which is used
chiefly for catching ostriches, consists of two round stones,
covered with leather, and united by a thin, plaited thong, about
8 ft. long. The other kind differs only in having three balls
united by thongs to a common centre. The Gaucho (native of
Spanish descent) holds the smallest of the three in his hand, and
whirls the other two around his head; then, taking aim, sends
them like chain shot revolving through the air. The balls no
sooner strike any object, than, winding round it, they cross each
other and become firmly hitched.&rdquo; Bolas have been used for
centuries in the South American pampas and even the forest

<p><span class="bold">BOLBEC,<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> a town of northern France, in the department of
Seine-Inférieure, on the Bolbec, 19 m. E.N.E. of Havre by rail.
Pop. (1906) 10,959. Bolbec is important for its cotton spinning
and weaving, and carries on the dyeing and printing of the fabric,
and the manufacture of sugar. There are a chamber of commerce
and a board of trade-arbitration. The town was enthusiastic
in the cause of the Reformed Religion in the 16th century,
and still contains many Protestants. It was burned almost to
the ground in 1765.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLE<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="bolos">&#946;&#8182;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, &ldquo;a clod of earth&rdquo;), a clay-like substance
of red, brown or yellow colour, consisting essentially of hydrous
aluminium silicate, with more or less iron. Most bole differs from
ordinary clay in not being plastic, but in dropping to pieces when
placed in water, thus behaving rather like fuller&rsquo;s-earth. Bole
was formerly in great repute medicinally, the most famous kind
being the Lemnian Earth (<span class="grk" title="gae Laemnia">&#947;&#8134; &#923;&#942;&#956;&#957;&#953;&#945;</span>), from the Isle of Lemnos
in the Greek Archipelago. The earth was dug with much ceremony
only once a year, and having been mixed with goats&rsquo; blood
was made into little cakes or balls, which were stamped by the
priests, whence they became known as <i>Terra sigillata</i> (&ldquo;sealed
earth&rdquo;). Large quantities of bole occur as red partings between
the successive lava flows of the Tertiary volcanic series in the
north of Ireland and the west of Scotland. Here it seems to have
resulted from the decomposition of the basalt and kindred rocks
by meteoric agencies, during periods of volcanic repose. In
Antrim the bole is associated with lithomarge, bauxite and
pisolitic iron-ore. Bole occurs in like manner between the great
sheets of the Deccan traps in India; and a similar substance is
also found interbedded with some of the doleritic lavas of Etna.</p>

<p>In the sense of stem or trunk of a tree, &ldquo;bole&rdquo; is from the
O. Norwegian <i>bolr</i>, of. Ger. <i>Bohle</i>, plank. It is probably
connected with the large number of words, such as &ldquo;boll,&rdquo;
&ldquo;ball,&rdquo; &ldquo;bowl,&rdquo; &amp;c., which stand for a round object.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLESLAUS I.,<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> called &ldquo;The Great,&rdquo; king of Poland (d. 1025),
was the son of Mieszko, first Christian prince of Poland, and the
Bohemian princess Dobrawa, or Bona, whose chaplain, Jordan,
converted the court from paganism to Catholicism. He succeeded
his father in 992. A born warrior, he speedily raised the little
struggling Polish principality on the Vistula to the rank of a
great power. In 996 he gained a seaboard by seizing Pomerania,
and subsequently took advantage of the troubles in Bohemia
to occupy Cracow, previously a Czech city. Like his contemporaries,
Stephen of Hungary and Canute of Denmark, Boleslaus
recognized from the first the essential superiority of Christianity
over every other form of religion, and he deserves with them
the name of &ldquo;Great&rdquo; because he deliberately associated himself
with the new faith. Thus despite an inordinate love of adventure,
which makes him appear rather a wandering chieftain than an
established ruler, he was essentially a man of insight and progress.
He showed great sagacity in receiving the fugitive Adalbert,
bishop of Prague, and when the saint suffered martyrdom at
the hands of the pagan Slavs (April 23, 997), Boleslaus purchased
his relics and solemnly laid them in the church of Gnesen, founded
by his father, which now became the metropolitan see of Poland.
It was at Gnesen that Boleslaus in the year 1000 entertained
Otto III. so magnificently that the emperor, declaring such a
man too worthy to be merely <i>princeps</i>, conferred upon him the
royal crown, though twenty-five years later, in the last year of
his life, Boleslaus thought it necessary to crown himself king
a second time. On the death of Otto, Boleslaus invaded
Germany, penetrated to the Elbe, occupying Stralsund and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>159</span>
Meissen on his way, and extended his dominions to the Elster
and the Saale. He also occupied Bohemia, till driven out by
the emperor Henry IV. in 1004. The German war was terminated
in 1018 by the peace of Bautzen, greatly to the advantage of
Boleslaus, who retained Lusatia. He then turned his arms against
Jaroslav, grand duke of Kiev, whom he routed on the banks
of the Bug, then the boundary between Russia and Poland.
For ten months Boleslaus remained at Kiev, whence he addressed
triumphant letters to the emperors of the East and West. At
his death in 1025 he left Poland one of the mightiest states of
Europe, extending from the Bug to the Elbe, and from the Baltic
to the Danube, and possessing besides the overlordship of Russia.
But his greatest achievement was the establishment in Poland
of a native church, the first step towards political independence.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLESLAUS II.,<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> called &ldquo;The Bold,&rdquo; king of Poland (1039-1081),
eldest son of Casimir I., succeeded his father in 1058.
The domestic order and tranquillity of the kingdom had been
restored by his painstaking father, but Poland had shrunk
territorially since the age of his grandfather Boleslaus I., and
it was the aim of Boleslaus II. to restore her dignity and
importance. The nearest enemy was Bohemia, to whom Poland had
lately been compelled to pay tribute for her oldest possession,
Silesia. But Boleslaus&rsquo;s first Bohemian war proved unsuccessful,
and was terminated by the marriage of his sister Swatawa with
the Czech king Wratyslaus II. On the other hand Boleslaus&rsquo;s
ally, the fugitive Magyar prince Bela, succeeded with Polish
assistance in winning the crown of Hungary. In the East
Boleslaus was more successful. In 1069 he succeeded in placing
Izaslaus on the throne of Kiev, thereby confirming Poland&rsquo;s
overlordship over Russia and enabling Boleslaus to chastise
his other enemies, Bohemia among them, with the co-operation
of his Russian auxiliaries. But Wratyslaus of Bohemia speedily
appealed to the emperor for help, and a war between Poland
and the Empire was only prevented by the sudden rupture of
Henry IV. with the Holy See and the momentous events which
led to the humiliating surrender of the emperor at Canossa.
There is nothing to show that Boleslaus took any part in this
struggle, though at this time he was on the best of terms with
Gregory VII. and there was some talk of sending papal legates
to restore order in the Polish Church. On the 26th of December
1076 Boleslaus encircled his own brows with the royal diadem,
a striking proof that the Polish kings did not even yet consider
their title quite secure. A second successful expedition to Kiev
to reinstate his <i>protégé</i> Izaslaus, is Boleslaus&rsquo;s last recorded
exploit. Almost immediately afterwards (1079) we find him an
exile in Hungary, where he died about 1081. The cause of this
sudden eclipse was the cruel vengeance he took on the <i>milites</i>,
or noble order, who, emulating the example of their brethren
in Bohemia, were already attempting to curb the royal power.
The churchmen headed by Stanislaus Szczepanowski, bishop of
Cracow, took the side of the nobles, whose grievances seem to
have been real. Boleslaus in his fury slew the saintly bishop,
but so general was the popular indignation that he had to fly
his kingdom.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOLESLAUS III.,<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> king of Poland (1086-1139), the son of
Wladislaus I. and Judith of Bohemia, was born on the 23rd of
December 1086 and succeeded his father in 1102. His earlier
years were troubled continually by the intrigues of his natural
half-brother Zbigniew, who till he was imprisoned and blinded
involved Boleslaus in frequent contests with Bohemia and the
emperor Henry V. The first of the German wars began in 1109, when
Henry, materially assisted by the Bohemians, invaded Silesia.
It was mainly a war of sieges, Henry sitting down before Lubusz,
Glogau and Breslau, all of which he failed to take. The Poles
avoided an encounter in the open field, but harried the Germans
so successfully around Breslau that the plain was covered
with corpses, which Henry had to leave to the dogs on his
disastrous retreat; hence the scene of the action was known as
&ldquo;the field of dogs.&rdquo; The chief political result of this disaster
was the complete independence of Poland for the next quarter
of a century. It was during this respite that Boleslaus devoted
himself to the main business of his life&mdash;the subjugation of
Pomerania (<i>i.e.</i> the maritime province) with the view of gaining
access to the sea. Pomerania, protected on the south by virgin
forests and almost impenetrable morasses, was in those days
inhabited by a valiant and savage Slavonic race akin to the
Wends, who clung to paganism with unconquerable obstinacy.
The possession of a seaboard enabled them to maintain fleets and
build relatively large towns such as Stettin and Kolberg, whilst
they ravaged at will the territories of their southern neighbours
the Poles. In self-defence Boleslaus was obliged to subdue
them. The struggle began in 1109, when Boleslaus inflicted a
terrible defeat on the Pomeranians at Nackel which compelled
their temporary submission. In 1120-1124 the rebellion of his
vassal Prince Warceslaus of Stettin again brought Boleslaus into
the country, but the resistance was as stout as ever, and only after
18,000 of his followers had fallen and 8000 more had been
expatriated did Warceslaus submit to his conqueror. The obstinacy
of the resistance convinced Boleslaus that Pomerania must be
christianized before it could be completely subdued; and this
important work was partially accomplished by St Otto, bishop
of Bamberg, an old friend of Boleslaus&rsquo;s father, who knew the
Slavonic languages. In 1124 the southern portions of the land
were converted by St Otto, but it was only under the threat of
extermination if they persisted in their evil ways that the people
of Stettin accepted the faith in the following year. In 1128,
at the council of Usedom, St Otto appointed his disciple
Boniface bishop of Julin, the first Pomeranian diocese, and the
foundation of a better order of things was laid. In his later years
Boleslaus waged an unsuccessful war with Hungary and Bohemia,
and was forced to claim the mediation of the emperor Lothair,
to whom he did homage for Pomerania and Rügen at the diet of
Merseburg in 1135. He died in 1139.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLETUS,<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> a well-marked genus of fungi (order <i>Polyporeae</i>),
characterized by the central stem, the cap or pileus, the soft,
fleshy tissue, and the vertical, closely-packed tubes or pores
which cover the under surface of the pileus and are easily
detachable. The species all grow on the ground, in woods or under
trees, in the early autumn. They are brown, red or yellow in
colour; the pores also vary in colour from pure white to brown,
red, yellow or green, and are from one or two lines to nearly
an inch long. A few are poisonous; several are good for eating.
One of the greatest favourites for the table is <i>Boletus edulis</i>,
recognized by its brown cap and white pores which become
green when old. It is the <i>ceps</i> of the continental European
markets. There are forty-nine British species of <i>Boletus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLEYN<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Bullen</span>), <span class="bold">ANNE</span> (<i>c.</i> 1507-1536), queen of Henry
VIII. of England, daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn, afterwards
earl of Wiltshire and Ormonde, and of Elizabeth, daughter of
Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey, afterwards duke of Norfolk,
was born, according to Camden, in 1507, but her birth has been
ascribed, though not conclusively, to an earlier date (to 1502 or
1501) by some later writers.<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> In 1514 she accompanied Mary
Tudor to France on the marriage of the princess to Louis XII.,
remained there after the king&rsquo;s death, and became one of the
women in waiting to Queen Claude, wife of Francis I. She
returned in 1521 or 1522 to England, where she had many
admirers and suitors. Among the former was the poet Sir Thomas
Wyatt,<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and among the latter, Henry Percy, heir of the
earl of Northumberland, a marriage with whom, however, was
stopped by the king and another match provided for her in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span>
person of Sir James Butler. Anne Boleyn, however, remained
unmarried, and a series of grants and favours bestowed by Henry
on her father between 1522 and 1525 have been taken, though
very doubtfully, as a symptom of the king&rsquo;s affections. Unlike
her sister Mary, who had fallen a victim to Henry&rsquo;s solicitations,<a name="fa3c" id="fa3c" href="#ft3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
Anne had no intention of being the king&rsquo;s mistress; she meant
to be his queen, and her conduct seems to have been governed
entirely by motives of ambition. The exact period of the beginning
of Anne&rsquo;s relations with Henry is not known. They have
been surmised as originating as early as 1523; but there is nothing
to prove that Henry&rsquo;s passion was anterior to the proceedings
taken for the divorce in May 1527, the celebrated love letters
being undated. Her name is first openly connected with the
king&rsquo;s as a possible wife in the event of Catherine&rsquo;s divorce, in
a letter of Mendoza, the imperial ambassador, to Charles V. of
the 16th of August 1527,<a name="fa4c" id="fa4c" href="#ft4c"><span class="sp">4</span></a> during the absence in France of
Wolsey, who, not blinded by passion like Henry, naturally
opposed the undesirable alliance, and was negotiating a marriage
with Renée, daughter of Louis XII. Henry meanwhile, however,
had sent William Knight, his secretary, on a separate mission to
Rome to obtain facilities for his marriage with Anne; and on the
cardinal&rsquo;s return in August he found her installed as the
king&rsquo;s companion and proposed successor to Catherine of Aragon.
After the king&rsquo;s final separation from his wife in July 1531,
Anne&rsquo;s position was still more marked, and in 1532 she accompanied
Henry on the visit to Francis I., while Catherine was left
at home neglected and practically a prisoner. Soon after their
return Anne was found to be pregnant, and in consequence
Henry married her about the 25th of January 1533<a name="fa5c" id="fa5c" href="#ft5c"><span class="sp">5</span></a> (the exact
date is unknown), their union not being made public till the
following Easter. Subsequently, on the 23rd of May, their
marriage was declared valid and that with Catherine null, and
in June Anne was crowned with great state in Westminster
Abbey. Anne Boleyn had now reached the zenith of her hopes.
A weak, giddy woman of no stability of character, her success
turned her head and caused her to behave with insolence and
impropriety, in strong contrast with Catherine&rsquo;s quiet dignity
under her misfortunes. She, and not the king, probably was the
author of the petty persecutions inflicted upon Catherine and
upon the princess Mary, and her jealousy of the latter showed
itself in spiteful malice. Mary was to be forced into the position
of a humble attendant upon Anne&rsquo;s infant, and her ears were to
be boxed if she proved recalcitrant. She urged that both should
be brought to trial under the new statute of succession passed in
1534, which declared her own children the lawful heirs to the
throne. She was reported as saying that when the king gave
opportunity by leaving England, she would put Mary to death
even if she were burnt or flayed alive for it.<a name="fa6c" id="fa6c" href="#ft6c"><span class="sp">6</span></a> She incurred the
remonstrances of the privy council and alienated her own friends
and relations. Her uncle, the duke of Norfolk, whom she was
reported to have treated &ldquo;worse than a dog,&rdquo; reviled her, calling
her a &ldquo;grande putaine.&rdquo; But her day of triumph was destined
to be even shorter than that of her predecessor. There were soon
signs that Henry&rsquo;s affection, which had before been a genuine
passion, had cooled or ceased. He resented her arrogance, and
a few months after the marriage he gave her cause for jealousy,
and disputes arose. A strange and mysterious fate had prepared
for Anne the same domestic griefs that had vexed and ruined
Catherine and caused her abandonment. In September 1533 the
birth of a daughter, afterwards Queen Elizabeth, instead of the
long-hoped-for son, was a heavy disappointment; next year
there was a miscarriage, and on the 29th of January 1536, the
day of Catherine&rsquo;s funeral, she gave birth to a dead male child.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May following the king suddenly broke up a
tournament at Greenwich, leaving the company in bewilderment
and consternation. The cause was soon known. Inquiries had
been made on reports of the queen&rsquo;s ill-conduct, and several
of her reputed lovers had been arrested. On the 2nd Anne
herself was committed to the Tower on a charge of adultery
with various persons, including her own brother, Lord Rochford.
On the 12th Sir Francis Weston, Henry Norris, William Brereton
and Mark Smeaton were declared guilty of high treason, while
Anne herself and Lord Rochford were condemned unanimously
by an assembly of twenty-six peers on the 15th. Her uncle, the
duke of Norfolk, presided as lord steward, and gave sentence,
weeping, that his niece was to be burned or beheaded as pleased
the king. Her former lover, the earl of Northumberland, left
the court seized with sudden illness. Her father, who was
excused attendance, had, however, been present at the trial
of the other offenders, and had there declared his conviction
of his daughter&rsquo;s guilt. On the 16th, hoping probably to save
herself by these means, she informed Cranmer of a certain
supposed impediment to her marriage with the king&mdash;according to
some accounts a previous marriage with Northumberland, though
the latter solemnly and positively denied it&mdash;which was never
disclosed, but which, having been considered by the archbishop
and a committee of ecclesiastical lawyers, was pronounced, on
the 17th, sufficient to invalidate her marriage. The same day
all her reputed lovers were executed; and on the 19th she herself
suffered death on Tower Green, her head being struck off with
a sword by the executioner of Calais brought to England for the
purpose.<a name="fa7c" id="fa7c" href="#ft7c"><span class="sp">7</span></a> She had regarded the prospect of death with courage
and almost with levity, laughing heartily as she put her hands
about her &ldquo;little neck&rdquo; and recalled the skill of the executioner.
&ldquo;I have seen many men&rdquo; (wrote Sir William Kingston, governor
of the Tower) &ldquo;and also women executed, and all they have
been in great sorrow, and to my knowledge this lady has much
joy and pleasure in death.&rdquo; On the following day Henry was
betrothed to Jane Seymour.</p>

<p>Amidst the vituperations of the adherents of the papacy and
the later Elizabethan eulogies, and in the absence of the records
on which her sentence was pronounced, Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s guilt
remains unproved. To Sir William Kingston she protested
her entire innocence, and on the scaffold while expressing her
submission she made no confession.<a name="fa8c" id="fa8c" href="#ft8c"><span class="sp">8</span></a> Smeaton alone of her
supposed lovers made a full confession, and it is possible that
his statement was drawn from him by threats of torture or hopes
of pardon. Norris, according to one account,<a name="fa9c" id="fa9c" href="#ft9c"><span class="sp">9</span></a> also confessed,
but subsequently declared that he had been betrayed into making
his statement. The others were all said to have &ldquo;confessed in
a manner&rdquo; on the scaffold, but much weight cannot be placed
on these general confessions, which were, according to the
custom of the time, a declaration of submission to the king&rsquo;s will
and of general repentance rather than acknowledgment of the
special crime. &ldquo;I pray God save the king,&rdquo; Anne herself is
reported to have said on the scaffold, &ldquo;and send him long to
reign over you, for a gentler nor a more merciful prince was
there never; and to me he was ever a good, a gentle and sovereign
lord.&rdquo; A principal witness for the charge of incest was Rochford&rsquo;s
own wife, a woman of infamous character, afterwards
executed for complicity in the intrigues of Catherine Howard.
The discovery of Anne&rsquo;s misdeeds coincided in an extraordinary
manner with Henry&rsquo;s disappointment in not obtaining by her
a male heir, while the king&rsquo;s despotic power and the universal
unpopularity of Anne both tended to hinder the administration
of pure justice. Nevertheless, though unproved, Anne&rsquo;s guilt
is more than probable. It is almost incredible that two grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>161</span>
juries, a petty jury, and a tribunal consisting of nearly all the
lay peers of England, with the evidence before them which we
do not now possess, should have all unanimously passed a sentence
of guilt contrary to the facts and their convictions, and that
such a sentence should have been supported by Anne&rsquo;s own
father and uncle. Every year since her marriage Anne had given
birth to a child, and Henry had no reason to despair of more;
while, if Henry&rsquo;s state of health was such as was reported, the
desire for children, which Anne shared with him, may be urged
as an argument for her guilt. Sir Francis Weston in a letter
to his family almost acknowledges his guilt in praying for pardon,
especially for offences against his wife;<a name="fa10c" id="fa10c" href="#ft10c"><span class="sp">10</span></a> Anne&rsquo;s own conduct
and character almost prepare us for some catastrophe. Whether
innocent or guilty, however, her fate caused no regrets and her
misfortunes did not raise a single champion or defender. The
sordid incidents of her rise, and the insolence with which she
used her triumph, had alienated all hearts from the unhappy
woman. Among the people she had always been intensely disliked;
the love of justice, and the fear of trade losses imminent
upon a breach with Charles V., combined to render her unpopular.
She appealed to the king&rsquo;s less refined instincts, and Henry&rsquo;s
deterioration of character may be dated from his connexion with
her. She is described as &ldquo;not one of the handsomest women
in the world; she is of a middling stature, swarthy complexion,
long neck, wide mouth, bosom not much raised, and in fact
has nothing but the English king&rsquo;s great appetite, and her eyes
which are black and beautiful, and take great effect.&rdquo;<a name="fa11c" id="fa11c" href="#ft11c"><span class="sp">11</span></a> Cranmer
admired her&mdash;&ldquo;sitting in her hair&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> with her hair falling
over her shoulders, which seems to have been her custom on
great occasions), &ldquo;upon a horse litter, richly apparelled,&rdquo; at
her coronation.<a name="fa12c" id="fa12c" href="#ft12c"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLGARI,<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Bolgary</span>, a ruined town of Russia, in the government
of Kazan, 4 m. from the left bank of the Volga, in 55°N.
lat. It is generally considered to have been the capital of the
Bulgarians when they were established in that part of Europe
(5th to 15th century). Ruins of the old walls and towers still
survive, as well as numerous <i>kurgans</i> or burial-mounds, with
inscriptions, some in Arabic (1222-1341), others in Armenian
(years 557, 984 and 986), and yet others in Turkic. Upon being
opened these tombs were found to contain weapons, implements,
utensils, and silver and copper coins, bearing inscriptions,
some in ordinary Arabic, others in Kufic (a kind of epigraphic
Arabic). These and other antiquities collected here (1722) are
preserved in museums at Kazan, Moscow and St Petersburg.
The ruins, which were practically discovered in the reign of
Peter the Great, were visited and described by Pallas, Humboldt
and others. The city of Bolgari was destroyed by the Mongols
in 1238, and again by Tamerlane early in the following century,
after which it served as the capital of the Khans (sovereign
princes) of the Golden Horde of Mongols, and finally, in the second
half of the 15th century it became a part of the principality
of Kazan, and so eventually of Russia. The Arab geographer
Ibn Haukal states that in his time, near the end of the 10th
century, it was a place of 10,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLINGBROKE, HENRY ST JOHN,<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> <span class="sc">Viscount</span> (1678-1751),
English statesman and writer, son of Sir Henry St John, Bart.
(afterwards 1st Viscount St John, a member of a younger branch
of the family of the earls of Bolingbroke and barons St John of
Bletso), and of Lady Mary Rich, daughter of the 2nd earl of
Warwick, was baptized on the 10th of October 1678, and was
educated at Eton. He travelled abroad during 1698 and 1699
and acquired an exceptional knowledge of French. The dissipation
and extravagance of his youth exceeded all limits and
surprised his contemporaries. He spent weeks in riotous orgies
and outdrank the most experienced drunkards. An informant
of Goldsmith saw him once &ldquo;run naked through the park in a
state of intoxication.&rdquo; Throughout his career he desired,
says Swift, his intimate friend, to be thought the Alcibiades
or Petronius of his age, and to mix licentious orgies with the
highest political responsibilities.<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> In 1700 he married
Frances, daughter of Sir Henry Winchcombe, Bart., of Bucklebury,
Berkshire, but matrimony while improving his fortune did not
redeem his morals.</p>

<p>He was returned to parliament in 1701 for the family borough
of Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire. He declared himself a Tory,
attached himself to Harley (afterwards Lord Oxford), then
speaker, whom he now addressed as &ldquo;dear master,&rdquo; and distinguished
himself by his eloquence in debate, eclipsing his schoolfellow,
Walpole, and gaining an extraordinary ascendancy over the House
of Commons. In May he had charge of the bill for securing
the Protestant succession; he took part in the impeachment
of the Whig lords for their conduct concerning the Partition
treaties, and opposed the oath abjuring the Pretender. In March
1702 he was chosen commissioner for taking the public accounts.
After Anne&rsquo;s accession he supported the bills in 1702 and 1704
against occasional conformity, and took a leading part in the
disputes which arose between the two Houses. In 1704 St John
took office with Harley as secretary at war, thus being brought
into intimate relations with Marlborough, by whom he was
treated with paternal partiality. In 1708 he quitted office with
Harley on the failure of the latter&rsquo;s intrigue, and retired to the
country till 1710, when he became a privy councillor and secretary
of state in Harley&rsquo;s new ministry, representing Berkshire in
parliament. He supported the bill for requiring a real property
qualification for a seat in parliament. In 1711 he founded the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>
Brothers&rsquo; Club, a society of Tory politicians and men of letters,
and the same year witnessed the failure of the two expeditions
to the West Indies and to Canada promoted by him. In 1712
he was the author of the bill taxing newspapers. But the great
business of the new government was the making of the peace
with France. The refusal of the Whigs to grant terms in 1706,
and again in 1709 when Louis XIV. offered to yield every point
for which the allies professed to be fighting, showed that the
war was not being continued for English national interests, and
the ministry were supported by the queen, the parliament and
the people in their design to terminate hostilities. But various
obstacles arose from the diversity of aims among the allies; and
St John was induced, contrary to the most solemn obligations, to
enter into separate and secret negotiations with France for the
security of English interests. In May 1712 St John ordered the
duke of Ormonde, who had succeeded Marlborough in the command,
to refrain from any further engagement. These instructions
were communicated to the French, though not to the allies,
Louis putting Dunkirk as security into possession of England,
and the shameful spectacle was witnessed of the desertion by
the English troops of their allies almost on the battlefield.
Subsequently St John received the congratulations of the French
minister, Torcy, on the occasion of the French victory over
Prince Eugene at Denain.</p>

<p>In August St John, who had on the 7th of July been created
Viscount Bolingbroke and Baron St John of Lydiard Tregoze,
went to France to conduct negotiations, and signed an armistice
between England and France for four months on the 19th. Finally
the treaty of Utrecht was signed on the 31st of March 1713 by all
the allies except the emperor. The first production of Addison&rsquo;s
<i>Cato</i> was made by the Whigs the occasion of a great
demonstration of indignation against the peace, and by Bolingbroke
for presenting the actor Booth with a purse of fifty guineas for
&ldquo;defending the cause of liberty against a perpetual dictator&rdquo;
(Marlborough). In the terms granted to England there was
perhaps little to criticize. But the manner of the peacemaking,
which had been carried on by a series of underhand conspiracies
with the enemy instead of by open conferences with the allies,
and was characterized throughout by a violation of the most
solemn international assurances, left a deep and lasting stain
upon the national honour and credit; and not less dishonourable
was the abandonment of the Catalans by the treaty. For all
this Bolingbroke must be held primarily responsible. In June
his commercial treaty with France, establishing free trade with
that country, was rejected. Meanwhile the friendship between
Bolingbroke and Harley, which formed the basis of the whole
Tory administration, had been gradually dissolved. In March
1711, by Guiscard&rsquo;s attempt on his life, Harley got the wound
which had been intended for St John, with all the credit. In
May Harley obtained the earldom of Oxford and was made lord
treasurer, while in July St John was greatly disappointed
at receiving only his viscountcy instead of the earldom lately
extinct in his family, and at being passed over for the Garter.
In September 1713 Swift came to London, and made a last but
vain attempt to reconcile his two friends. But now a further
cause of difference had arisen. The queen&rsquo;s health was visibly
breaking, and the Tory ministers could only look forward to
their own downfall on the accession of the elector of Hanover.
Both Oxford<a name="fa2d" id="fa2d" href="#ft2d"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and Bolingbroke had maintained for some time
secret communications with James, and promised their help in
restoring him at the queen&rsquo;s death. The aims of the former,
prudent, procrastinating and vacillating by nature, never
extended probably beyond the propitiation of his Tory followers;
and it is difficult to imagine that Bolingbroke could have really
advocated the Pretender&rsquo;s recall, whose divine right he repudiated
and whose religion and principles he despised. Nevertheless,
whatever his chief motive may have been, whether to displace
Oxford as leader of the party, to strengthen his position
and that of the faction in order to dictate terms to the future
king, or to reinstate James, Bolingbroke, yielding to his more
impetuous and adventurous disposition, went much further
than Oxford. It is possible to suppose a connexion between
his zeal for making peace with France and a desire to forward
the Pretender&rsquo;s interests or win support from the Jacobites.<a name="fa3d" id="fa3d" href="#ft3d"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
During his diplomatic mission to France he had incurred blame
for remaining at the opera while the Pretender was present,<a name="fa4d" id="fa4d" href="#ft4d"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
and according to the Mackintosh transcripts he had several
secret interviews with him. Regular communications were kept
up subsequently. In March 1714 Herville, the French envoy
in London, sent to Torcy, the French foreign minister in Paris,
the substance of two long conversations with Bolingbroke in which
the latter advised patience till after the accession of George,
when a great reaction was to be expected in favour of the Pretender.
At the same time he spoke of the treachery of Marlborough and
Berwick, and of one other, presumably Oxford, whom he refused
to name, all of whom were in communication with Hanover.<a name="fa5d" id="fa5d" href="#ft5d"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
Both Oxford and Bolingbroke warned James
that he could have little chance of success unless he changed
his religion, but the latter&rsquo;s refusal (March 13) does not appear
to have stopped the communications. Bolingbroke gradually
superseded Oxford in the leadership. Lady Masham, the queen&rsquo;s
favourite, quarrelled with Oxford and identified herself with
Bolingbroke&rsquo;s interests. The harsh treatment of the Hanoverian
demands was inspired by him, and won favour with the queen,
while Oxford&rsquo;s influence declined; and by his support of the
Schism Bill in May 1714, a violent Tory measure forbidding all
education by dissenters by making an episcopal licence obligatory
for schoolmasters, he probably intended to compel Oxford to give
up the game. Finally, a charge of corruption brought by Oxford
in July against Bolingbroke and Lady Masham, in connexion
with the commercial treaty with Spain, failed, and the lord
treasurer was dismissed or retired on the 27th of July.</p>

<p>Bolingbroke was now supreme, and everything appeared
tending inevitably to a Jacobite restoration. The Jacobite Sir
William Windham had been made chancellor of the exchequer,
important military posts were placed in the hands of the faction,
and a new ministry of Jacobites was projected. But now the
queen&rsquo;s sudden death on the 1st of August, and the appointment
of Shrewsbury to the lord treasurership, instantly changed the
whole scene and ruined Bolingbroke. &ldquo;The earl of Oxford was
removed on Tuesday,&rdquo; he wrote to Swift on the 3rd of August,
&ldquo;the queen died on Sunday! What a world is this and how
does fortune banter us!&rdquo; According to Herville, the French
envoy, Bolingbroke declared to him that in six weeks he could
have secured everything. Nevertheless the exact nature of
his projects remains obscure. It is probable that his statement
in his letter to Windham that &ldquo;none of us had any very settled
resolution&rdquo; is true, though his declaration in the <i>Patriot
King</i> that &ldquo;there were no designs on foot ... to place the
crown on the head of the Pretender&rdquo; is a palpable falsehood. His
great object was doubtless to gain supreme power and to keep
it by any means, and by any betrayal that the circumstances
demanded; and it is not without significance perhaps that on
the very day of Oxford&rsquo;s dismissal he gave a dinner to the Whig
leaders, and on the day preceding the queen&rsquo;s death ordered
overtures to be made to the elector.<a name="fa6d" id="fa6d" href="#ft6d"><span class="sp">6</span></a></p>

<p>On the accession of George I. the illuminations and bonfire at
Lord Bolingbroke&rsquo;s house in Golden Square were &ldquo;particularly
fine and remarkable,&rdquo;<a name="fa7d" id="fa7d" href="#ft7d"><span class="sp">7</span></a> but he was immediately dismissed from office.
He retired to Bucklebury and is said to have now
written the answer to the <i>Secret History of the White Staff</i>
accusing him of Jacobitism. In March 1715 he in vain attempted
to defend the late ministry in the new parliament; and on the
announcement of Walpole&rsquo;s intended attack upon the authors
of the treaty of Utrecht he fled in disguise (March 28, 1715)
to Paris, where he was well received, after having addressed
a letter to Lord Lansdowne from Dover protesting his innocence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>163</span>
and challenging &ldquo;the most inveterate of his enemies to produce
any instance of his criminal correspondence.&rdquo; Bolingbroke
in July entirely identified himself with the interests of the
Pretender, whose secretary he became, and on the 10th of
September he was attainted. But his counsel was neglected
for that of ignorant refugees and Irish priests. The expedition of
1715 was resolved upon against his advice. He drew up James&rsquo;s
declaration, but the assurances he had inserted concerning the
security of the Church of England were cancelled by the priests.
He remained at Paris, and endeavoured to establish relations
with the regent. On the return of James, as the result of petty
intrigues and jealousies, Bolingbroke was dismissed from his
office. He now renounced all further efforts on the Pretender&rsquo;s
behalf.<a name="fa8d" id="fa8d" href="#ft8d"><span class="sp">8</span></a> Replying to Mary of Modena, who had sent a message
deprecating his ill-will, he wished his arm might rot off if he ever
used pen or sword in their service again!<a name="fa9d" id="fa9d" href="#ft9d"><span class="sp">9</span></a></p>

<p>He now turned to the English government in hopes of pardon.
In March 1716 he declared his final abandonment of the Pretender
and promised to use his influence to secure the withdrawal of
his friends; but he refused to betray any secrets or any individuals.
He wrote his <i>Reflexions upon Exile</i>, and in 1717 his
letter to Sir W. Windham in explanation of his position, generally
considered one of his finest compositions, but not published
till 1753 after his death. The same year he formed a liaison
with Marie Claire Deschamps de Marcilly, widow of the marquis
de Villette, whom he married in 1720 after the death in 1718
of Lady Bolingbroke, whom he had treated with cruel neglect.
He bought and resided at the estate of La Source near Orleans,
studied philosophy, criticized the chronology of the Bible, and
was visited amongst others by Voltaire, who expressed unbounded
admiration for his learning and politeness. In 1723,
through the medium of the king&rsquo;s mistress, the duchess of Kendal,
he at last received his pardon, returned to London in June or
July, and placed his services at the disposal of Walpole, by whom,
however, his offers to procure the accession of several Tories to
the administration were received very coldly. During the
following winter he made himself useful in France in gaining
information for the government. In 1725 an act was passed
enabling him to hold real estate but without power of alienating
it.<a name="fa10d" id="fa10d" href="#ft10d"><span class="sp">10</span></a> But this had been effected in consequence of a peremptory
order of the king, against Walpole&rsquo;s wishes, who succeeded in
maintaining his exclusion from the House of Lords. He now
bought an estate at Dawley, near Uxbridge, where he renewed his
intimacy with Pope, Swift and Voltaire, took part in Pope&rsquo;s
literary squabbles, and wrote the philosophy for the <i>Essay on
Man</i>. On the first occasion which offered itself, that of Pulteney&rsquo;s
rupture with Walpole in 1726, he endeavoured to organize an
opposition in conjunction with the former and Windham; and
in 1727 began his celebrated series of letters to the <i>Craftsman</i>,
attacking the Walpoles, signed an &ldquo;Occasional Writer.&rdquo; He
gained over the duchess of Kendal with a bribe of £11,000 from
his wife&rsquo;s estates, and with Walpole&rsquo;s approval obtained an
audience with George. His success was imminent, and it was
thought his appointment as chief minister was assured. In
Walpole&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;as St John had the duchess entirely
on his side I need not add what must or might in time have been
the consequence,&rdquo; and he prepared for his dismissal. But once
more Bolingbroke&rsquo;s &ldquo;fortune turned rotten at the very moment
it grew ripe,&rdquo;<a name="fa11d" id="fa11d" href="#ft11d"><span class="sp">11</span></a> and his projects and hopes were ruined by the
king&rsquo;s death in June.<a name="fa12d" id="fa12d" href="#ft12d"><span class="sp">12</span></a> Further papers from his pen signed
&ldquo;John Trot&rdquo; appeared in the <i>Craftsman</i> in 1728, and in 1730
followed <i>Remarks on the History of England by Humphrey Oldcastle</i>,
attacking the Walpoles&rsquo; policy. The assault on the government
prompted by Bolingbroke was continued in the House of
Commons by Windham, and great efforts were made to establish
the alliance between the Tories and the Opposition Whigs.
The Excise Bill in 1733 and the Septennial Bill in the following
year offered opportunities for further attacks on the government,
which Bolingbroke supported by a new series of papers in the
<i>Craftsman</i> styled &ldquo;A Dissertation on Parties&rdquo;; but the whole
movement collapsed after the new elections, which returned
Walpole to power in 1735 with a large majority.</p>

<p>Bolingbroke retired baffled and disappointed from the fray
to France in June, residing principally at the château of Argeville
near Fontainebleau. He now wrote his <i>Letters on the Study of
History</i> (printed privately before his death and published in
1752), and the <i>True Use of Retirement</i>. In 1738 he visited
England, became one of the leading friends and advisers of
Frederick, prince of Wales, who now headed the opposition,
and wrote for the occasion <i>The Patriot King</i>, which together with
a previous essay, <i>The Spirit of Patriotism</i>, and <i>The State of
Parties at the Accession of George I.</i>, were entrusted to Pope and
not published. Having failed, however, to obtain any share
in politics, he returned to France in 1739, and subsequently sold
Dawley. In 1742 and 1743 he again visited England and
quarrelled with Warburton. In 1744 he settled finally at Battersea
with his friend Hugh Hume, 3rd earl of Marchmont,
and was present at Pope&rsquo;s death in May. The discovery that
the poet had printed secretly 1500 copies of <i>The Patriot King</i>
caused him to publish a correct version in 1749, and stirred up
a further altercation with Warburton, who defended his friend
against Bolingbroke&rsquo;s bitter aspersions, the latter, whose conduct
was generally reprehended, publishing a <i>Familiar Epistle
to the most Impudent Man Living</i>. In 1744 he had been very
busy assisting in the negotiations for the establishment of the
new &ldquo;broad bottom&rdquo; administration, and showed no sympathy
for the Jacobite expedition in 1745. He recommended the tutor
for Prince George, afterwards George III. About 1749 he wrote
the <i>Present State of the Nation</i>, an unfinished pamphlet. Lord
Chesterfield records the last words heard from him: &ldquo;God who
placed me here will do what He pleases with me hereafter and
He knows best what to do.&rdquo; He died on the 12th of December
1751, his wife having predeceased him in 1750. They were both
buried in the parish church at Battersea, where a monument
with medallions and inscriptions composed by Bolingbroke was
erected to their memory.</p>

<p>The writings and career of Bolingbroke make a far weaker
impression upon posterity than they made on contemporaries.
His genius and character were superficial; his abilities were
exercised upon ephemeral objects, and not inspired by lasting
or universal ideas. Bute and George III. indeed derived their
political ideas from <i>The Patriot King</i>, but the influence which he
is said to have exercised upon Voltaire, Gibbon and Burke is
very problematical. Burke wrote his <i>Vindication of Natural
Society</i> in imitation of Bolingbroke&rsquo;s style, but in refutation of
his principles; and in the <i>Reflections on the French Revolution</i>
he exclaims, &ldquo;Who now reads Bolingbroke, who ever read him
through?&rdquo; Burke denies that Bolingbroke&rsquo;s words left &ldquo;any
permanent impression on his mind.&rdquo; Bolingbroke&rsquo;s conversation,
described by Lord Chesterfield as &ldquo;such a flowing happiness
of expression that even his most familiar conversations if taken
down in writing would have borne the press without the least
correction,&rdquo; his delightful companionship, his wit, good looks,
and social qualities which charmed during his lifetime and made
firm friendships with men of the most opposite character, can
now only be faintly imagined. His most brilliant gift was his
eloquence, which according to Swift was acknowledged by men
of all factions to be unrivalled. None of his great orations has
survived, a loss regretted by Pitt more than that of the missing
books of Livy and Tacitus, and no art perishes more completely
with its possessor than that of oratory. His political works, in
which the expression is often splendidly eloquent, spirited and
dignified, are for the most part exceedingly rhetorical in style,
while his philosophical essays were undertaken with the chief
object of displaying his eloquence, and no characteristic renders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>164</span>
writings less readable for posterity. They are both deficient in
solidity and in permanent interest. The first deals with mere
party questions without sincerity and without depth; and the
second, composed as an amusement in retirement without any
serious preparation, in their attacks on metaphysics and theology
and in their feeble deism present no originality and carry no
conviction. Both kinds reflect in their Voltairian superficiality
Bolingbroke&rsquo;s manner of life, which was throughout uninspired
by any great ideas or principles and thoroughly false and superficial.
Though a libertine and a free-thinker, he had championed
the most bigoted and tyrannical high-church measures. His diplomacy
had been subordinated to party necessities. He had
supported by turns and simultaneously Jacobite and Hanoverian
interests. He had only conceived the idea of <i>The Patriot King</i>
in the person of the worthless Frederick in order to stir up
sedition, while his eulogies on retirement and study were pronounced
from an enforced exile. He only attacked party
government because he was excluded from it, and only railed
at corruption because it was the corruption of his antagonists
and not his own. His public life presents none of those acts of
devotion and self-sacrifice which often redeem a career characterized
by errors, follies and even crimes.</p>

<p>One may deplore his unfortunate history and wasted genius,
but it is impossible to regret his exclusion from the government
of England. He was succeeded in the title as 2nd Viscount
Bolingbroke, according to the special remainder, by his nephew
Frederick, 3rd Viscount St John (a title granted to Bolingbroke&rsquo;s
father in 1716), from whom the title has descended.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOLIVAR, SIMON<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> (1783-1830), the hero of South American
independence, was born in the city of Caracas, Venezuela, on
the 24th of July 1783. His father was Juan Vicente Bolivar y
Ponte, and his mother Maria Concepcion Palacios y Sojo, both
descended from noble families in Venezuela. Bolivar was sent
to Europe to prosecute his studies, and resided at Madrid for
several years. Having completed his education, he spent some
time in travelling, chiefly in the south of Europe, and visited
Paris, where he was an eye-witness of some of the last scenes of
the Revolution. Returning to Madrid, he married, in 1801, the
daughter of Don N. Toro, uncle of the marquis of Toro in Caracas,
and embarked with her for Venezuela, intending, it is said, to
devote himself to the improvement of his large estate. But the
premature death of his young wife, who fell a victim to yellow
fever, drove him again to Europe. Returning home in 1809
he passed through the United States, where, for the first time,
he had an opportunity of observing the working of free institutions;
and soon after his arrival in Venezuela he appears to have
identified himself with the cause of independence which had
already agitated the Spanish colonies for some years. Being one
of the promoters of the insurrection at Caracas in April 1810,
he received a colonel&rsquo;s commission from the revolutionary junta,
and was associated with Louis Lopez Mendez in a mission to the
court of Great Britain. Venezuela declared its independence on
the 5th of July 1811, and in the following year the war commenced
in earnest by the advance of Monteverde with the Spanish
troops. Bolivar was entrusted with the command of the important
post of Puerto Cabello, but not being supported he had to
evacuate the place; and owing to the inaction of Miranda the
Spaniards recovered their hold over the country.</p>

<p>Like others of the revolutionists Bolivar took to flight, and
succeeded in reaching Curaçao in safety. He did not, however,
remain long in retirement, but in September 1812, hearing of
important movements in New Granada, repaired to Cartagena,
where he received a commission to operate against the Spanish
troops on the Magdalena river. In this expedition he proved
eminently successful, driving the Spaniards from post to post,
until arriving at the confines of Venezuela he boldly determined
to enter that province and try conclusions with General Monteverde
himself. His troops did not number more than 500 men;
but, in spite of many discouragements, he forced his way to
Merida and Truxillo, towns of some importance in the west of
Venezuela, and succeeded in raising the population to his
support. Forming his increased forces into two divisions, he
committed the charge of one to his colleague Rivas, and pushing
on for Caracas the capital, issued his decree of &ldquo;war to the
death.&rdquo; A decisive battle ensued at Lastoguanes, where the
Spanish troops under Monteverde sustained a crushing defeat.
Caracas was entered in triumph on the 4th of August 1813,
and Monteverde took refuge in Puerto Cabello. General Mariño
effected the liberation of the eastern district of Venezuela, and
the patriots obtained entire possession of the country in January
1814. This success was, however, of very brief duration. The
royalists, effectually roused by the reverses they had sustained,
concentrated all their means, and a number of sanguinary
encounters ensued. Bolivar was eventually defeated by Boves
near Cura, in the plains of La Puerta, and compelled to embark
for Cumana with the shattered remains of his forces. Caracas was
retaken by the Spaniards in July; and before the end of the year
1814 the royalists were again the undisputed masters of Venezuela.
From Cumana Bolivar repaired to Cartagena, and thence to
Tunja, where the revolutionary congress of New Granada was
sitting. Here, notwithstanding his misfortunes and the efforts
of his personal enemies, he was received and treated with great
consideration. The congress appointed him to conduct an expedition
against Santa Fé de Bogota, where Don Cundinamarca
had refused to acknowledge the new coalition of the provinces.
In December 1814 he appeared before Bogota with a force of
2000 men, and obliged the recalcitrant leaders to capitulate,&mdash;a
service for which he received the thanks of congress. In
the meanwhile Santa Martha had fallen into the hands of the
royalists, and Bolivar was ordered to the relief of the place. In
this, however, he was not successful, General Morillo having
landed an overwhelming Spanish force. Hopeless of the attempt
he resigned his commission and embarked for Kingston, Jamaica,
in May 1814. While residing there an attempt was made upon
his life by a hired assassin, who, in mistake, murdered his
secretary.</p>

<p>From Kingston Bolivar went to Aux Cayes in Haiti, where he
was furnished with a small force by President Petion. An
expedition was organized, and landed on the mainland in May
1816, but proved a failure. Nothing daunted, however, he obtained
reinforcements at Aux Cayes, and in December landed
first in Margarita, and then at Barcelona. Here a provisional
government was formed, and troops were assembled to resist
Morillo, who was then advancing at the head of a strong division.
The hostile forces encountered each other on the 16th of February
1817, when a desperate conflict ensued, which lasted during that
and the two following days, and ended in the defeat of the royalists.
Morillo retired in disorder, and being met on his retreat by J.A.
Paez with his <i>llaneros</i>, suffered an additional and more complete
overthrow. Being now recognized as commander-in-chief, Bolivar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>
proceeded in his career of victory, and before the close of the
year had fixed his headquarters at Angostura on the Orinoco.
At the opening of the congress which assembled in that city
on the 15th February 1819 he submitted an elaborate exposition
of his views on government, and concluded by surrendering his
authority into the hands of congress. Being, however, required
to resume his power, and retain it until the independence of the
country had been completely established, he reorganized his
troops, and set out from Angostura, in order to cross the
Cordilleras, effect a junction with General Santander, who commanded
the republican force in New Granada, and bring their
united forces into action against the common enemy. This bold
and original design was crowned with complete success. In
July 1819 he entered Tunja, after a sharp action on the adjoining
heights; and on the 7th of August he gained the victory of
Boyaca, which gave him immediate possession of Bogota and all
New Granada.</p>

<p>His return to Angostura was a sort of national festival. He
was hailed as the deliverer and father of his country, and all
manner of distinctions and congratulations were heaped upon
him. Availing himself of the favourable moment, he obtained
the enactment of the fundamental law of the 17th of December
1819, by which the republics of Venezuela and New Granada
were henceforth to be united in a single state, under his presidency,
by the title of the Republic of Colombia. The seat of
government was also transferred provisionally to Rosario de
Cucuta, on the frontier of the two provinces, and Bolivar again
took the field. Being now at the head of the most numerous
and best appointed army the republicans had yet assembled,
he gained important advantages over the Spaniards under
Morillo, and on the 25th of November 1820 concluded at Truxillo
an armistice of six months, probably in the hope that the Spaniards
would come to terms, and that the further effusion of blood
might be spared. If such were his views, however, they were
disappointed. Morillo was recalled, and General Torre assumed
the command. The armistice was allowed to expire, and a
renewal of the contest became inevitable. Bolivar therefore
resolved, if possible, to strike a decisive blow; and this accordingly
he did at Carabobo, where, encountering Torre, he so
completely routed the Spaniards that the shattered remains of
their army were forced to take refuge in Puerto Cabello, where
two years after they surrendered to Paez. The battle of Carabobo
may be considered as having put an end to the war in Venezuela.
On the 29th of June 1821 Bolivar entered Caracas, and by the
close of the year the Spaniards were driven from every part of
the province except Puerto Cabello. The next step was to
secure, by permanent political institutions, the independence
which had been so dearly purchased; and, accordingly, on the
30th of August 1821 the constitution of Colombia was adopted
with general approbation, Bolivar himself being president, and
Santander vice-president.</p>

<p>There was, however, more work for him to do. The Spaniards,
though expelled from Colombia, still held possession of the neighbouring
provinces of Ecuador and Peru; and Bolivar determined
to complete the liberation of the whole country. Placing himself
at the head of the army, he marched on Quito in Ecuador.
A severe battle was fought at Pichincha, where, by the prowess
of his colleague Sucre, the Spaniards were routed, and Quito
was entered by the republicans in June 1822. Bolivar then
marched upon Lima, which the royalists evacuated at his
approach; and entering the capital in triumph, he was invested
with absolute power as dictator, and authorized to call into
action all the resources of the country. Owing, however, to the
intrigues of the republican factions in Peru he was forced to
withdraw to Truxillo, leaving the capital to the mercy of the
Spaniards under Canterac, by whom it was immediately occupied.
But this misfortune proved only temporary. By June
1824 the liberating army was completely organized; and taking
the field soon after, it routed the vanguard of the enemy. Improving
his advantage, Bolivar pressed forward, and on the 6th
of August defeated Canterac on the plains of Junin, after which
he returned to Lima, leaving Sucre to follow the royalists in
their retreat to Upper Peru&mdash;an exploit which the latter executed
with equal ability and success, gaining a decisive victory at
Ayacucho, and thus completing the dispersion of the Spanish
force. The possessions of the Spaniards in Peru were now
confined to the castles of Callao, which Rodil maintained for
upwards of a year, in spite of all the means that could be employed
for their reduction. In June 1825 Bolivar visited Upper
Peru, which, having detached itself from the government of
Buenos Aires, was formed into a separate state, called Bolivia,
in honour of the liberator. The first congress of the new
republic assembled in August 1825, when Bolivar was declared
perpetual protector, and requested to prepare for it a constitution
of government.</p>

<p>His care was now directed to the administration of the affairs
of the freed provinces. His endeavours to satisfy his countrymen
in this respect did not always meet with encouragement, and
sometimes exposed him to slander. In December 1824 Bolivar
convoked a constituent congress for the February following;
but this body, taking into consideration the unsettled state of the
country, thought it proper to invest him with dictatorial power
for another year. His project of a constitution for Bolivia was
presented to the congress of that state on the 25th of May 1826,
accompanied with an address, in which he embodied his opinions
respecting the form of government which he conceived most
expedient for the newly established republics. This code, however,
did not give satisfaction. Its most extraordinary feature
consisted in the provision for lodging the executive authority
in the hands of a president for life, without responsibility and
with power to nominate his successor, a proposal which alarmed
the friends of liberty, and excited lively apprehensions amongst
the republicans of Buenos Aires and Chile; whilst in Peru,
Bolivar was accused of a design to unite into one state Colombia,
Peru and Bolivia, and to render himself perpetual dictator of the
confederacy.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the affairs of Colombia had taken a turn
which demanded the presence of Bolivar in his own country.
During his absence Santander had administered the government
of the state ably and uprightly, and its independence had been
recognized by other countries. But Paez, who commanded in
Venezuela, having been accused of arbitrary conduct in the enrolment
of the citizens of Caracas in the militia, refused obedience
to the summons of the senate, and placed himself in a state of
open rebellion against the government, being encouraged by a
disaffected party in the northern departments who desired
separation from the rest of the republic.</p>

<p>Accordingly, having entrusted the government to a council
nominated by himself, with Santa Cruz at its head, Bolivar set
out from Lima in September 1826, and hastening to Bogota,
arrived there on the 14th of November. He immediately
assumed the extraordinary powers which by the constitution
the president was authorized to exercise in case of rebellion.
After a short stay in the capital he pressed forward to stop the
effusion of blood in Venezuela, where matters had gone much
farther than he could have contemplated. On the 31st of
December he reached Puerto Cabello, and the following day he
issued a decree offering a general amnesty. He had then a
friendly meeting with Paez and soon after entered Caracas, where
he fixed his headquarters, in order to check the northern departments,
which had been the principal theatre of the disturbances.
In the meanwhile Bolivar and Santander were re-elected to the
respective offices of president and vice-president, and by law they
should have qualified as such in January 1827. In February, however,
Bolivar formally resigned the presidency of the republic, at the
same time expressing a determination to refute the imputations
of ambition which had been so freely cast upon him, by retiring
into private life, and spending the remainder of his days on his
patrimonial estate. Santander combated this proposal, urging
him to resume his station as constitutional president, and declaring
his own conviction that the troubles and agitations of the
country could only be appeased by the authority and personal
influence of the liberator himself. This view being confirmed
by a resolution of congress, although it was not a unanimous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span>
one, Bolivar decided to resume his functions, and he repaired to
Bogota to take the oaths. Before his arrival, however, he issued
simultaneously three separate decrees&mdash;one granting a general
amnesty, another convoking a national convention at Ocaña,
and a third for establishing constitutional order throughout
Colombia. His arrival was accelerated by the occurrence of
events in Peru and the southern departments which struck at the
very foundation of his power. Not long after his departure from
Lima, the Bolivian code had been adopted as the constitution
of Peru, and Bolivar had been declared president for life on the
9th of December 1826, the anniversary of the battle of Ayacucho.
At this time the Colombian auxiliary army was cantoned in Peru,
and the third division, stationed at Lima, consisting of veteran
troops under Lara and Sands, became distrustful of Bolivar&rsquo;s
designs on the freedom of the republic. Accordingly, in about
six weeks after the adoption of Bolivar&rsquo;s new constitution, a
counter-revolution in the government of Peru was effected by
this body of dissatisfied veterans, and the Peruvians, availing
themselves of the opportunity, abjured the Bolivian code, deposed
the council appointed by the liberator, and proceeded
to organize a provisional government for themselves. After this
bloodless revolution the third division embarked at Callao on the
17th of March 1827, and landed in the southern department of
Colombia in the following month. Intelligence of these events
reached Bolivar while in the north of Colombia, and he lost no
time in preparing to march against the refractory troops, who
formerly had placed such implicit confidence in him. But he
was spared the necessity of coming to blows, for the leaders,
finding the government in the hands of the national executive,
had peaceably submitted to General Ovando. In the meanwhile
Bolivar had accepted the presidency, and resumed the functions
belonging to his official position. But although Colombia was,
to all external appearance, restored to tranquillity, the nation
was divided into two parties. Bolivar had, no doubt, regained
the personal confidence of the officers and soldiers of the third
division; but the republican party, with Santander at their
head, continued to regard with undisguised apprehension his
ascendancy over the army, suspecting him of a desire to imitate
the career of Napoleon. In the meanwhile all parties looked
anxiously to the convention of Ocaña, which was to assemble in
March 1828, for a decided expression of the national will. The
republicans hoped that the issue of its deliberations would be
favourable to their views; whilst the military, on the other hand,
did not conceal their conviction that a stronger and more permanent
form of government was essential to the public welfare.
The latter view seems to have prevailed. In virtue of a decree,
dated Bogota, the 27th of August 1828, Bolivar assumed the
supreme power in Colombia, and continued to exercise it until
his death, which took place at San Pedro, near Santa Marta, on
the 17th of December 1830.</p>

<p>Bolivar spent nine-tenths of a splendid patrimony in the
service of his country; and although he had for a considerable
period unlimited control over the revenues of three countries&mdash;Colombia,
Peru and Bolivia&mdash;he died without a shilling of public
money in his possession. He achieved the independence of three
states, and called forth a new spirit in the southern portion of
the New World. He purified the administration of justice; he
encouraged the arts and sciences; he fostered national interests,
and he induced other countries to recognize that independence
which was in a great measure the fruit of his own exertions.
His remains were removed in 1842 to Caracas, where a monument
was erected to his memory; a statue was put up in Bogota
in 1846; in 1858 the Peruvians followed the example by erecting
an equestrian statue of the liberator in Lima; and in 1884 a
statue was erected in Central Park, New York.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Twenty-two volumes of official documents bearing on Bolivar&rsquo;s
career were officially published at Caracas in 1826-1833. There are
lives by Larrazabal (New York, 1866); Rojas (Madrid, 1883); and
Ducoudray-Holstein (Paris, 1831). Two volumes of his correspondence
were published in New York in 1866.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLÍVAR,<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> till 1908 a department of Colombia, bounded
N. and W. by the Caribbean Sea, E. by the departments of
Magdalena and Santander, S. by Antioquia and S.W. by Cauca.
It has an area of 27,028 sq. m., composed in great part of low,
alluvial plains, densely wooded, but slightly cultivated and
unsuited for north European labour. The population, estimated
at 323,097 in 1899, is composed largely of mixed races; in some
localities the inhabitants of mixed race are estimated to constitute
four-fifths of the population. The capital, Cartagena on the
Caribbean coast, was once the principal commercial entrepôt of
Colombia. Other important towns are Barranquilla and
Mompox (8000), on the Magdalena river, and Corozal (9000)
and Lorica (10,596 in 1902), near the western coast.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOLÍVAR,<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> an inland state of Venezuela, lying S. of the
Orinoco and Apure, with the Yuruari territory on the E., the
Caroni river forming the boundary, and the Amazonas territory
and Brazil on the S. Frequent political changes in Venezuela
have led to various modifications in the size and outlines of this
state, which comprises large areas of uninhabited territory. It
is a country of extensive plains (<i>llanos</i>) covered in the rainy
season with nutritious grass which disappears completely in the
dry season, and of great forests and numerous rivers. Its
population was given in 1894 as 135,232, but its area has been
largely reduced since then. The capital is Ciudad Bolívar,
formerly called Angostura, which is situated on the right bank
of the Orinoco about 240 m. above its mouth; pop. 11,686.
Vessels of light draught easily ascend the Orinoco to this point,
and a considerable trade is carried on, the exports being cocoa,
sugar, cotton, hides, jerked beef and various forest products.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOLIVIA,<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> an inland republic of South America, once a part
of the Spanish vice-royalty of Peru and known as the province
of Charcas, or Upper Peru. It is the third largest political
division of the continent, and extends, approximately, from
9° 44&prime; to 22° 50&prime; S. lat., and from 58° to 70° W. long. It is
bounded N. and E. by Brazil, S. by Paraguay and Argentina,
and W. by Chile and Peru. Estimates of area vary widely and
have been considerably confused by repeated losses of territory
in boundary disputes with neighbouring states, and no figures
can be given which may not be changed to some extent by
further revisions. Official estimates are 640,226 and 703,633
sq. m., but Supan (<i>Die Bevolkerung der Erde</i>, 1904) places it at
515,156 sq. m.</p>

<p><i>Boundaries.</i>&mdash;The boundary line between Bolivia and Brazil
has its origin in the limits between the Spanish and Portuguese
colonies determined by the treaties of Madrid and San Ildefonso
(1750 and 1777), which were modified by the treaties of 1867
and 1903. Beginning at the outlet of Bahia Negra into the
Paraguay river, lat. 28° 08&prime; 35&Prime; S., the line ascends the latter
to a point on the west bank 9 kilometres below Fort Coimbra,
thence inland 4 kilometres to a point in lat. 19° 45&prime; 36&Prime; S. and
long. 58° 04&prime; 12.7&Prime; W., whence it follows an irregular course N.
and E. of N. to Lakes Mandioré, Gaiba or Gahiba, and Uberaba,
then up the San Matias river and N. along the Sierra Ricardo
Franco to the headwaters of the Rio Verde, a tributary of the
Guaporé. This part of the boundary was turned inland from
the Paraguay to include, within Brazilian jurisdiction, Fort
Coimbra, Corumbá and other settlements on the west bank, and
was modified in 1903 by the recession of about 1158 sq. m. to
Bolivia to provide better commercial facilities on the Paraguay.
The line follows the Verde, Guaporé, Mamoré and Madeira
rivers down to the mouth of the Abuna, in about lat. 9° 44&prime; S.,
as determined by the treaty of 1903. This is a part of the
original colonial frontier, which extended down the Madeira to a
point midway between the Beni and the Amazon, and then ran
due W. to the Javary. The treaty of 1867 changed this starting-point
to the mouth of the Beni, in lat. 10° 20&prime; S., and designated a
straight line to the source of the Javary as the frontier, which
gave to Brazil a large area of territory; but when the valuable rubber
forests of the upper Purús became known the Brazilians invaded
them and demanded another modification of the boundary line.
This was finally settled in 1903 by the treaty of Petropolis,
which provided that the line should ascend the Abuna river to
lat. 10° 20&prime; S., thence along that parallel W. to the Rapirran river
which is followed to its principal source, thence due W. to the
Ituxy river which is followed W. to its source, thence to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>167</span>
source of Bahia Creek which is followed to the Acré or Aquiry
river, thence up the latter to its source, whence if east of the
69th meridian it runs direct to the 11th parallel which will form
the boundary line to the Peruvian frontier. This frontier gave
about 60,000 sq. m. of territory to Brazil, for which the latter
gave an indemnity of £2,000,000 and about 1158 sq. m. of
territory on the Matto Grosso frontier. The boundary with
Paraguay is unsettled, but an unratified treaty of the 23rd of
November 1894 provides that the line shall start from a point on
the Paraguay river 3 m. north of Fort Olimpo and run south-west
in a straight line to an intersection with the Pilcomayo in long.
61° 28&prime; W., where it unites with the Argentine boundary. The
boundary with Chile was greatly modified by the results of the
war of 1879-83, as determined by the treaties of 1884, 1886 and
1895, Bolivia losing her department of the littoral on the Pacific
and all access to the coast except by the grace of the conqueror.
Provisions were made in 1895 for the cession of the port of
Mejillones del Norte and a right of way across the province of
Tarapacá, but Peru protested, and negotiations followed for the
cession of Cobija, in the province of Antofagasta. These negotiations
proved fruitless, and in 1904 Bolivia accepted a pecuniary
indemnity in lieu of territory. The new boundary line starts
from the summit of the Sapaleri (or Zapalegui), where the
Argentine, Bolivian and Chilean boundaries converge, and runs
west to Licancaur, thence north to the most southern source of
Lake Ascotán which it follows to and across this lake in the
direction of the Oyahua volcano, and thence in a straight line
to the Tua volcano, on the frontier of the province of Tarapacá.
From this point the line follows the summits of the Cordillera
Silillica north to the Cerro Paquiza, on the Tacna frontier, and
to the Nevado Pomarape, near the frontier of Peru. Thence it
continues north to an intersection with the Desaguadero, in about
16° 45&prime; S. lat., follows that river to the Winamarca lagoon and
Lake Titicaca, and crosses the latter diagonally to Huaicho on
the north shore. From this point the line crosses the Cordillera
Real through the valley of the San Juan del Oro to Suches Lake,
follows the Cololo and Apolobamba ranges to the headwaters of
the Sina river, and thence down that stream to the Inambari.
Thence the line either follows the latter to its confluence with the
Madre de Dios, or the water-parting between that river and the
Tambopata or Pando, to the valley of the Madre de Dios, from
which point it runs due north to 12° 40&prime; S. lat., and north-west to
the new Brazilian frontier. The N.W. angle on the map represents
the Bolivian claim until the settlement of 1909, which gave
the territory to Peru.</p>

<p><i>Physiography.</i>&mdash;Roughly calculated, two-fifths of the total area
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>
of Bolivia is comprised within the Andean cordilleras which cross
its south-west corner and project east toward the Brazilian highlands
in the form of a great obtuse angle. The Cordilleras, divided
into two great parallel chains, with flanking ranges and spurs to
the east, reach their greatest breadth at this point and form
the <i>massif</i> of the Andean system. It is made up of a number
of parallel ranges enclosing great elevated plateaus broken by
transverse ranges and deep ravines. North-east of Lake Titicaca
there is a confused mass or knot (the Nudo de Apolobamba)
of lofty intersecting ridges which include some of the highest
peaks in South America. Below this mountainous area the
ranges open out and enclose extensive plateaus. The western
range, the Cordillera Occidental, a part of the boundary between
Bolivia and the northern provinces of Chile, closely follows the
coast outline and forms the western rampart of the great Bolivian
tableland or <i>alta-planicie</i>, which extends from the Vilcanota
knot in Peru, south to the Serrania de Lipez on the Argentine
frontier, is 500 m. long, and about 80 m. broad, and contains
about 40,000 sq. m. The northern part of this plateau is commonly
called the <i>puna</i>; the southern part, the &ldquo;desert of
Lipez,&rdquo; in character and appearance is part of the great Puna
de Atacama. This plateau has an average elevation of about
12,650 ft. near Lake Titicaca, but descends about 1000 ft. toward
its southern extremity. It is a great lacustrine basin where once
existed an inland sea having an outlet to the east through the
La Paz gorge. The plateau is bleak and inhospitable in the
north, barren and arid toward the south, containing great saline
depressions covered with water in the rainy season, and broken
by ridges and peaks, the highest being the Cerro de Tahua,
17,454 ft. Overlooking the plateau from the west are the snow-clad
peaks of Pomarape (20,505 ft.), Parinacota (20,918 ft.),
Sajama (21,047), Huallatiri (21,654), Lirima (19,128), and the
three volcanic peaks, Oyahua (19,226), San Pedro y Pablo
(19,423) and Licancaur (19,685). The eastern rampart of this
great plateau is formed by the Cordillera Oriental, which extends
north-west into Peru under the name of Carabaya, and
south to the frontier in broken ranges, one of which trends south-east
in the vicinity of Sucré. The main part of this great range,
known as the Cordillera Real, and one of the most imposing
mountain masses of the world, extends from the Peruvian border
south-east to the 18th parallel and exhibits a series of snow-crowned
peaks, notably the triple-crested Illampu or Sorata
(21,490 ft.), Illimani (Conway, 21,204), Cacaaca (20,571) and
Chachacomani (21,434). Of the ranges extending south from
the Cordillera Real and branching out between the 18th and 19th
parallels, the more prominent are the Frailes which forms the
eastern rampart of the great central plateau and which is celebrated
for its mineral deposits, the Chichas which runs south from
the vicinity of Potosi to the Argentine frontier, and the Livichuco
which turns south-east and forms the watershed between the
Cachimayo and Pilcomayo. The more prominent peaks in and
between these ranges are the Asanaque (16,857), Michaga
(17,389), Cuzco (17,930), Potosi (15,381), Chorolque (18,480)
and Tuluma (15,584). At the southern extremity of the great
plateau is the transverse Serrania de Lipez, the culminating
crest of which stands 16,404 ft. above sea-level. The eastern
rampart of the Bolivian highlands comprises two distinct
chains&mdash;the Sierra de Cochabamba on the north-east and the
Sierra de Misiones on the east. Between these and the Cordillera
Oriental is an apparently confused mass of broken, intersecting
ranges, which on closer examination are found to conform more
or less closely to the two outside ranges. These have been
deeply cut by rivers, especially on the north-east, where the rainfall
is heavier. The region enclosed by these ranges is extremely
rugged in character, but it is esteemed highly for its fertile
valleys and its fine climate, and is called the &ldquo;Bolivian Switzerland.&rdquo;
Lying wholly within the tropics, these mountain masses
form one of the most interesting as well as one of the most
imposing and difficult regions of the world. At their feet and in
their lower valleys the heat is intense and the vegetation is
tropical. Above these are cool, temperate slopes and valleys,
and high above these, bleak, wind-swept passes and snow-clad
peaks. West of the Cordillera Oriental, where special conditions
prevail, a great desert plateau stretches entirely across one corner
of the republic. Apart from the Andean system there is a group
of low, broken, gneiss ranges stretching along the east side of
Bolivia among the upper affluents of the Mamoré and Guaporé,
which appear to belong to the older Brazilian orographic system,
from which they have been separated by the erosive action of
water. They are known as the Sierras de Chiquitos, and are
geologically interesting because of their proximity to the eastern
projection of the Andes. Their culminating point is Cerro
Cochii, 3894 ft. above sea-level, but for the most part they are
but little more than ranges of low wooded hills, having in general
a north-west and south-east direction between the 15th and 19th
parallels.</p>

<p>The popular conception of Bolivia is that of an extremely
rugged mountainous country, although fully three-fifths of it,
including the Chiquitos region, is composed of low alluvial
plains, great swamps and flooded bottomlands, and gently
undulating forest regions. In the extreme south are the Bolivian
Chaco and the llanos (open grassy plains) of Manzo, while above
these in eastern Chuquisaca and southern Santa Cruz are extensive
swamps and low-lying plains, subject to periodical inundations
and of little value for agricultural and pastoral purposes. There
are considerable areas in this part of Bolivia, however, which
lie above the floods and afford rich grazing lands. The great
drawback to this region is defective drainage; the streams have
too sluggish a current to carry off the water in the rainy season.
Between the Chiquitos sierras and the Andes are the Llanos de
Chiquitos, which have a higher general elevation and a more
diversified surface. North of this elevation, which formed the
southern shore of the ancient Mojos Lake, are the llanos of
Guarayos and Mojos, occupying an extensive region traversed
by the Guaporé, San Miguel, Guapay, Mamoré, Yacuma, Beni
and Madre de Dios rivers and their numerous tributaries. It
was once covered by the great Mojos Lake, and still contains
large undrained areas, like that of Lake Rojoagua (or Roguaguado).
It contains rich agricultural districts and extensive open plains
where cattle-raising has been successfully followed since the
days of the Jesuit missions in that region. The lower slopes of
the Andes, especially toward the north-west, where the country
is traversed by the Beni and Madre de Dios, are covered with
heavy forests. This is one of the richest districts of Bolivia and
is capable of sustaining a large population.</p>

<p>The river-systems of Bolivia fall naturally into three distinct
regions&mdash;the Amazon, La Plata and Central Plateau. The first
includes the rivers flowing directly and indirectly into the
Madeira, one of the great tributaries of the Amazon, together
with some small tributaries of the Acré and Purús in the north,
all of which form a drainage basin covering more than one-half
of the republic. The two principal rivers of this system are the
Mamoré and Beni, which unite in lat. 10° 20&prime; S. to form the
Madeira. The Mamoré, the upper part of which is called the
Chimoré, rises on the north-east slopes of the Sierra de Cochabamba
a little south of the 17th parallel, and follows a northerly
serpentine course to its confluence with the Beni, the greater
part of which course is between the 65th and 66th meridians.
The river has a length of about 600 m., fully three-fourths of
which, from Chimoré (925 ft. above sea level) to the rapids near
its mouth, passes across a level plain and is navigable. The
principal Bolivian tributary of the Mamoré, the Guapay or Grande,
which is larger and longer than the former above their confluence
and should be considered the main stream, rises in the Cordillera
Oriental east of Lake Pampa Aullaguas, and flows east to the
north extremity of the Sierra de Misiones, where it emerges upon
the Bolivian lowlands. Turning to the north in a magnificent
curve, it passes around the south-east extremity of the Sierra de
Cochabamba, skirts the Llanos de Chiquitos, and, turning to the
north-west, unites with the Mamoré at Junta de los Rios in about
15° 20&prime; S. lat. and 64° 40&prime; W. long. It has a tortuous course
of over 700 m., which is described as not navigable. The
principal tributaries of the Guapay are the Mizque, Piray or
Sará and Yapacani, the last rising on the east slopes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>169</span>
Cordillera Real, flowing east by Cochabamba to the sierras of
that name where it breaks through with a great bend to the north.
The other large Bolivian tributaries of the Mamoré, all rising on
the north-east flanks of the Andes, are the Chaparé, Sécure,
Manique or Aperé and Yacuma, the last draining a region of
lakes and swamps north of the Sierra Chamaya. The Beni and
its great affluent, the Madre de Dios, though of smaller volume
and extent than the Mamoré, are of much greater economic
importance, owing to their navigability, the fertility of the
region they drain, and the great forests along their banks.
North of the Beni, the Abuna flows into the Madeira. Several
of its south tributaries belong to Bolivia. The Guaporé, or
Itenez, an affluent of the Mamoré, is the third large river of
this Bolivian drainage basin, but it rises in Brazil, on the
south slopes of the Sierra dos Parecis, where it flows in a great
bend to the south and then west of north to the Bolivian
frontier in 14° S. lat. From this point to its junction with the
Mamoré, a little north of the 12th parallel, it flows in a northwesterly
direction and forms the boundary line between the two
republics. Its Brazilian tributaries are comparatively unimportant,
but from Bolivia it receives the Baures and the San Miguel,
both rising in the Sierras de Chiquitos and flowing north-west
across the llanos to the Guaporé. The Baures has one large
tributary, the Blanco, and the Itonama (San Miguel) has its
origin in Lake Conception, lying among the west ranges of the
Chiquitos mountains 952 ft. above sea-level.</p>

<p>The south-east drainage basin, which is smaller and economically
less important than that of the Madeira, discharges into the
Paraguay and extends from the Sierras de Chiquitos south to
the Argentine frontier, and from the Cordillera Oriental east
to the Paraguay. It possesses only one large river in Bolivia,
the Pilcomayo, which rises on the east slopes of the Cordillera
Oriental opposite the south end of Lake Pampa Aullaguas and
flows east and south-east through the sierra region to the Bolivian
Chaco. It flows through a nearly level country with so sluggish
a current that its channels are greatly obstructed. Nothing
definite is known of its tributaries in the Chaco, but in the sierra
region it possesses a number of small tributaries, the largest of
which are the Cachimayo, Mataca and Pílaya or Camblaya, the
latter formed by the Cotagaita and San Juan. The Bermejo,
which is an Argentine river, receives one large tributary from
the Bolivian uplands, the Tarija or Rio Grande, which drains
a small district south-east of the Santa Victoria sierra. The
Bolivian tributaries of the upper Paraguay are small and unimportant.
The Otuquis, the most southern of the group, is
formed by the San Rafael and Tucabaca, which drain both
slopes of the Cerro Cochii range; but is lost in some great
marshes 50 m. from the Paraguay. Another considerable stream
of this region, which is lost in the great marshy districts of the
Bolivian plain, is the Parapiti, which rises on the eastern slopes
of the Sierra de Misiones and flows north-east through a low
plain for about 150 m. until lost.</p>

<p>The third drainage basin is that of the great central plateau,
or <i>alta-planicie</i>. This is one of the most elevated lacustrine
basins in the world, and though it once drained eastward, now
has no surface outlet. Lake Titicaca receives the waters of
several short streams from the neighbouring heights and discharges
through the Desaguadero, a sluggish river flowing south
for 184 m. with a gradually diminishing depth to Lake Pampa
Aullaguas or Poopo. The Desaguadero is navigable for small
craft, and has two or three small tributaries from the west. Two
small streams empty into Lake Pampa Aullaguas, which has a
small outlet in the Lacahahuira flowing west for 60 m. to the
Cienegas de (salt-swamps of) Coipasa. The drainage of this
extensive district seems to be wholly absorbed by the dry soil
of the desert and by evaporation. In the extreme south the Rio
Grande de Lipez is absorbed in the same way.</p>

<p>Few of the Bolivian lakes are at all well known. The great
lacustrine basin between the Beni and the Mamoré contains
several lakes and lagoons, two of them of large size. These are
Lake Rogagua whose waters find their way into the Beni through
Rio Negro, and the Roguaguado lagoon and marshes which
cover a large area of territory near the Mamoré. The latter has
an elevation little, if any, above the level of the Mamoré, which
apparently drains this region, and its area has been estimated
at about 580 sq. m. Lake Conceptión, in the Chiquitos mountains,
belongs to this same hydrographic area. In the south-east
there are several large shallow lakes whose character and size
change with the season. They fill slight depressions and are
caused by defective drainage. Near the Paraguay there are
several of these lakes, partly caused by obstructed outlets, such
as Bahia Negra, Cáceres, Mandioré, Gaiba and Uberaba, some
of them of sufficient depth to be navigable by small craft. Above
the latter are the great Xarayes swamps, sometimes described
as a lake. This region, like that of the north, is subject to
periodical inundations in the summer months (November-March
or even May), when extensive areas of level country are flooded
and traffic is possible only by the use of boats. The two principal
lakes of the plateau region are Titicaca and Pampa Aullaguas or
Poopo. The former lies near the north end of the great Bolivian
<i>alta-planicie</i>, 12,644 ft. above sea-level, being one of the most
elevated lakes of the world. It is indented with numerous bays
and coves; its greatest length is 138 m., and its greatest breadth
69 m. According to a survey made by Dr M. Neveau-Lemaire
(<i>La Geographie</i>, ix. p. 409, Paris, 1904), its water surface, excluding
islands and peninsulas, is 1969 sq. m., and its greatest depth
is 892 ft. The level of the lake rises about 5 in. in summer; the
loss in winter is even greater. The lake belongs to both Bolivia
and Peru, and is navigated by steamers running between Bolivian
ports and the Peruvian railway port of Puno. The outlet of the
lake is through the Desaguadero river. It has several islands,
the largest of which bears the same name and contains highly
interesting archaeological monuments of a prehistoric civilization
usually attributed to the Incas. Lake Pampa Aullaguas or
Poopo is about 180 m. south-east of Titicaca, and is fed principally
by its outflow. It lies 505 ft. below the level of Titicaca,
which gives an average fall for the Desaguadero of very nearly
2¾ ft. per mile. The Pampa Aullaguas has an estimated area of
386 sq. m., and has one large inhabited island. The lake is
shallow and the district about it is sparsely populated. Its
outlet is through the Lacahahuira river into the Coipasa swamp,
and it is estimated that the outflow is much less than the inflow,
showing a considerable loss by evaporation and earth absorption.</p>

<p>Having no sea-coast, Bolivia has no seaport except what may
be granted in usufruct by Chile.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology</i>.&mdash;The eastern ranges of ihe Bolivian Andes are formed of
Palaeozoic rocks with granitic and other intrusions; the Western
Cordillera consists chiefly of Jurassic and Cretaceous beds, together
with the lavas and ashes of the great volcanoes; while the intervening
plateau is covered by freshwater and terrestrial deposits
through which rise ridges of Palaeozoic rock and of a series of red
sandstones and gypsiferous marls of somewhat uncertain age (probably,
in part at least, Cretaceous). The Palaeozoic beds have yielded
fossils of Cambrian, Ordovician, Devonian and Carboniferous age.
In southern Bolivia Cambrian and Ordovician beds form the greater
part of the eastern Andes, but farther north the Devonian and
Carboniferous are extensively developed, especially in the north-eastern
ranges. The hills, known as the Chiquitos, which rise from
the plains of eastern Bolivia, are composed of ancient sedimentary
rocks of unknown age. The Palaeozoic beds are directly overlaid
by a series of red sandstones and gypsiferous marls, similar to the
<i>formacion petrolifera</i> of Argentina and Brazil. At the base there is
frequently a conglomerate or tuff of porphyritic rocks. Marine
fossils found by Gustav Steinmann in the middle of the series are
said to indicate an age not earlier than the Jurassic, and Steinmann
refers them to the Lower Cretaceous. It is, however, not improbable
that the series may represent more than one geological system. No
later marine deposits have been found either in the eastern Andes
or in the plains of Bolivia, but freshwater beds of Tertiary and later
date occupy a wide area. The recent deposits, which cover so large
a part of the depression between the Eastern and the Western
Cordillera, appear to be partly of torrential origin, like the talus-fans
at the foot of mountain ranges in other dry regions; but Lakes
Titicaca and Pampa Aullaguas (Poopo) were undoubtedly at one
time rather more extensive than they are to-day. The volcanoes of
Bolivia lie almost entirely in the Western Cordillera&mdash;the great
summits of the eastern range, such as Illimani and Sorata, being
formed of Palaeozoic rocks with granitic and other intrusions.
The gold, silver and tin of Bolivia occur chiefly in the Palaeozoic
rocks of the eastern ranges. The copper belongs mostly to the red
sandstone series.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span></p>

<p><i>Climate</i>.&mdash;Bolivia lies wholly within the torrid zone, and
variations in temperature are therefore due to elevation, mountain
barriers and prevailing winds. The country possesses
every gradation of temperature, from that of the tropical lowlands
to the Arctic cold of the snow-capped peaks directly above.
This vertical arrangement of climatic zones is modified to some
extent (less than in Argentina) by varying rainfall conditions,
which are governed by the high mountain ranges crossing one
corner of the republic, and also by the prevailing winds. The
trade winds give to S. Bolivia a wet and dry season similar to
that of N. Argentina. Farther north, and east of the Cordillera
Oriental, rains fall throughout the year, though the summer
months (November-March) are usually described as the rainy
season. On the west side of the Cordillera, which extracts the
moisture from the prevailing easterly winds, the elevated plateaus
have a limited rainfall in the north, which diminishes toward the
south until the surface becomes absolutely barren. Brief and
furious rain-storms sometimes sweep the northern plateau, but
these are not frequent and occur during a short season only.
Electrical wind storms are frequent in these high altitudes.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Bolivia has a wide range of temperature between places of the
same latitude. The natives designate the Bolivian climatic zones as
<i>yungas, valle</i> or <i>medio yungas, cabezera de valle, puna</i> and <i>puna brava</i>.
The <i>yungas</i> comprises all the lowlands and the mountain valleys
up to an elevation of 5000 ft. The temperature is tropical, winter
is unknown and the atmosphere is exceedingly humid. The mean
temperature, according to official estimates, is 70° F., but this probably
represents the average between the higher elevations and the
low country. The <i>valle</i> zone includes the deep valleys from 5000 to
9500 ft., has a warm climate with moderate variations in temperature
and no cold weather, is sub-tropical in character and productions,
and is sometimes described as a region of perpetual summer. The
<i>cabezera de valle</i>, as the name indicates, includes the heads of the
deep valleys above the <i>valle</i> zone, with elevations ranging from
9500 to 11,000 ft.; its climate is temperate, is divided into regular
seasons, and is favourable to the production of cereals and vegetables.
The <i>puna</i>, which lies between 11,000 and 12,500 ft., includes the
great central plateau of Bolivia. It has but two seasons, a cold
summer or autumn and winter. The air is cold and dry, and the
warmer season is too short for the production of anything but
potatoes and barley. The mean temperature is officially estimated
as 54° F. The <i>puna brava</i> extends from 12,500 ft. up to the snow
limit (about 17,500 ft.), and covers a bleak, inhospitable territory,
inhabited only by shepherds and miners. Above this is the region
of eternal snow, an Arctic zone within the tropics. In general, the
sub-tropical (<i>valle</i>) and temperate (<i>cabezera de valle</i>) regions of
Bolivia are healthy and agreeable, have a plentiful rainfall, moderate
temperature in the shade, and varied and abundant products.
There is a high rate of mortality among the natives, due to unsanitary
habits and diet, and not to the climate. In the tropical
<i>yungas</i> the ground is covered with decaying vegetation, and malaria
and fevers are common. There are localities in the open country
and on exposed elevations where healthy conditions prevail, but the
greater part of this region is considered unhealthy. The prevailing
winds are easterly, bringing moisture across Brazil from the Atlantic,
but eastern Bolivia is also exposed to hot, oppressive winds from the
north, and to violent cold winds (<i>surazos</i>) from the Argentine plains,
which have been known to cause a fall of temperature of 36° within
a few hours. According to the <i>Sinópsis Estadistica y Geográfica de
la República de Bolivia</i> (La Paz, 1903), the average mean temperature
and the annual rainfall in eastern Bolivia are as follows: 10° S. lat.,
90.8° F. and 31.5 in. rainfall; 15° S. lat., 86° F. and 30.7 in. rainfall;
20° S. lat., 81° F. and 30 in. rainfall; and 25° S. lat., 76.8° F. and
29.3 in. rainfall.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Fauna.</i>&mdash;The indigenous fauna of Bolivia corresponds closely
to that of the neighbouring districts of Argentina, Brazil and
Peru. Numerous species of monkeys inhabit the forests of the
tropical region, together with the puma, jaguar, wildcat, coati,
tapir or <i>anta</i>, sloth, ant-bear, paca (<i>Coelogenys paca</i>) and capybara.
A rare species of bear, the <i>Ursus ornatus</i> (spectacled bear)
is found among the wooded Andean foothills. The chinchilla
(<i>C. laniger</i>), also found in northern Argentina and Chile, inhabits
the colder plateau regions and is prized for its fur. The plateau
species of the viscacha (<i>Lagidium cuvieri</i>) and the widely
distributed South American otter (<i>Lutra paranensis</i>) are also
hunted for their skins. The peccary, which prefers a partially open
country, ranges from the Chaco to the densely wooded districts
of the north. There are two or three species of deer, the most
common being the large marsh deer of the Chaco; but the deer
are not numerous. The armadillo, opossum, ferret and skunk
are widely distributed. The amphibia are well represented
throughout the lower tropical districts. Alligators are found in
the tributaries of the Paraguay and their lagoons, lizards and
turtles are numerous, and the batrachians are represented by
several species. Snakes are also numerous, including rattlesnakes
and the great boa-constrictors of the Amazon region.</p>

<p>The most interesting of all the Bolivian animals, however, are
the guanaco (<i>Auchenia huanaco</i>) and its congeners, the llama
(<i>A. llama</i>), alpaca (<i>A. pacos</i>) and vicuña (<i>A. vicugna</i>), belonging
to the Camelidae, with the structure and habits of the African
camel, but smaller, having no hump, and inhabiting a mountainous
and not a level sandy region. They are able to go without
food and drink for long periods, and inhabit the arid and semi-arid
plateaus of the Andes and the steppes of Patagonia. The
guanaco is supposed to be the original type, is the largest of the
four, and has the greatest range from Peru to Tierra del Fuego.
The llama and alpaca were domesticated long before the discovery
of America, but the guanaco and vicuña are found in a
wild state only. The llama is used as a pack animal in Bolivia
and Peru, and its coarse wool is used in the making of garments
for the natives. The alpaca is highly prized for its fine wool,
which is a staple export from Bolivia, but the animal is reared
with difficulty and the product cannot be largely increased.
The vicuña also is celebrated for its wool, which the natives
weave into beautiful and costly <i>ponchos</i> (blanket cloaks) and
other wearing apparel. The guanaco is hunted for its skin,
which, when dressed, makes an attractive rug or robe. The
slaughter of the guanaco and vicuña is rapidly diminishing
their number. The rearing of llamas and alpacas is a recognized
industry in the Bolivian highlands and is wholly in the hands of
the Indians, who alone seem to understand the habits and
peculiarities of these interesting animals.</p>

<p>Of birds and insects the genera and species are very numerous
and interesting. The high sierras are frequented by condors
and eagles of the largest size, and the whole country by the
common vulture, while the American ostrich (<i>Rhea americanus</i>)
and a species of large stork (the <i>bata</i> or <i>jaburú</i>, <i>Mycteria americana</i>;
maximum height, 8 ft.; spread of wings, 8 ft. 6 in.) inhabit
the tropical plains and valleys. Waterfowl are numerous and
the forests of the warm valleys are filled with song-birds and
birds of beautiful plumage. Many species of humming-birds
are found even far up in the mountains, and great numbers of
parrots, araras and toucans, beautiful of feather but harsh of
voice, enliven the forests of the lowlands.</p>

<p>Like other South American states, Bolivia benefited greatly
from the introduction of European animals. Horses, cattle,
sheep, goats, swine and poultry were introduced, and are now
sources of food and wealth to a large part of the population.
Mules are used to a large extent as pack animals, but they are
imported from Argentina. Silkworms have been bred with
success in some departments, and the cochineal insect is found
wherever the conditions are favourable for the cactus.</p>

<p><i>Flora</i>.&mdash;Owing to the diversities in altitude the flora of Bolivia
represents every climatic zone, from the scanty Arctic vegetation
of the lofty Cordilleras to the luxuriant tropical forests of the
Amazon basin. Between these extremes the diversity in vegetable
life is as great as that of climate and soil. The flora of
Bolivia has been studied less than the flora of the neighbouring
republics, however, because of the inaccessibility of these inland
regions. Among the more important productions, the potato,
oca (<i>Oxalis tuberosa</i>), quinoa (<i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>) and some
coarse grasses characterize the puna region, while barley, an
exotic, is widely grown for fodder. Indian corn was cultivated
in the temperate and warm regions long before the advent of
Europeans, who introduced wheat, rye, oats, beans, pease and
the fruits and vegetables of the Old World, for each of which a
favourable soil and climate was easily found. In the sub-tropical
and tropical zones the indigenous plants are the sweet potato,
cassava (<i>Manihot utilissima</i> and <i>M. aipi</i>), peanuts, pineapple,
guava, chirimoya (<i>Anona cherimolia</i>), pawpaw (<i>Carica
papaya</i>), <i>ipecacuanha</i> (<i>Cephaelis</i>), sarsaparilla, vanilla, false
jalap (<i>Mirabilis jalapa</i>), copaiba, tolu (<i>Myroxylon toluiferum</i>),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
rubber-producing trees, dyewoods, cotton and a great number of
beautiful hardwoods, such as jacarandá, mahogany, rosewood,
quebracho, colo, cedar, walnut, &amp;c. Among the fruits many of the
most common are exotics, as the orange, lemon, lime, fig, date,
grape, &amp;c., while others, as the banana, caj&#363; or cashew (<i>Anacardium
occidentale</i>) and aguacate avocado or alligator pear, have
a disputed origin. Coca, one of the most important plants of
the country, is cultivated on the eastern slopes of the Andes
at an altitude of 5000 to 6000 ft., where the temperature is
uniform and frosts are unknown. Quina or calisaya is a natural
product of the eastern Andes, and is found at an altitude of 3000
to 9000 ft. above sea-level. The calisaya trees of Bolivia rank
among the best, and their bark forms an important item in her
foreign trade. The destructive methods of collecting the bark
are steadily diminishing the natural sources of supply, and
experiments in cinchona cultivation were undertaken during the
last quarter of the 19th century, with fair prospects of success.
The most important of the indigenous forest products, however,
is rubber, derived principally from the <i>Hevea guayanensis</i> (var.
<i>brasiliensis</i>), growing along the river courses in the <i>yungas</i>
regions of the north, though Maniçoba rubber is also obtained
from <i>Manihot Glaziovii</i> on the drier uplands. Among the
exotics, sugar-cane, rice and tobacco are cultivated in the warm
districts.</p>

<p><i>Population</i>.&mdash;The population of Bolivia is composed of Indians,
Caucasians of European origin, and a mixture of the two races,
generally described as <i>mestizos</i>. There is also a very small
percentage of Africans, descendants of the negro slaves introduced
in colonial times. A roughly-taken census of 1900 gives the
total population as 1,816,271, including the Litoral department,
now belonging to Chile (49,820), and estimates the number of wild
Indians of the forest regions at 91,000. Of this total, 50.7%
were classed as Indians, 12.8% as whites, 26.8% as <i>mestizos</i>,
0.3% as negroes, and 9.4% as unknown. In 1904 an official estimate
made the population 2,181,415, also including
the Litoral (59,784), but of course all census returns
and estimates in such a country are subject to
many allowances. The Indian population (920,860)
is largely composed of the so-called civilized tribes
of the Andes, which once formed part of the
nationality ruled by the Incas, and of those of the
Mojos and Chiquitos regions, which were organized
into industrial communities by the Jesuits in the
l7th century. The former, which are chiefly
Aymarás south of the latitude of Lake Titicaca,
attained a considerable degree of civilization
before the discovery of America and have been in
closer contact with Europeans than the other tribes
of Bolivia. It is doubtful, however, whether
their condition has been improved under these influences.
The Mojos and Chiquitos tribes, also, have been less prosperous
since the expulsion of the Jesuits, but they have
remained together in organized communities, and have
followed the industries and preserved the religion taught them
as well as circumstances permitted. Both these groups of
Indians are peaceable and industrious, and form an important
labouring element. They are addicted to the excessive use
of <i>chica</i> (a native beer made from Indian corn), and have
little or no ambition to improve their condition, but this
may be attributed in part to their profound ignorance and to
the state of peonage in which they are held. Inhabiting the
southern part of the Bolivian plain are the Chiriguanos, a
detached tribe of the Guarani race which drifted westward to
the vicinity of the Andes long ago. They are of a superior
physical and mental type, and have made noteworthy progress
toward civilization. They are agriculturists and stock-raisers
and have the reputation of being peaceable and industrious.
The remaining native tribes under the supervision of the state
have made little progress, and their number is said to be decreasing
(notwithstanding the favourable climatic conditions under which
most of them live) because of unsanitary and intemperate habits,
and for other causes not well understood, one being the custom
noticed by early travellers among some of the tribes of the La
Plata region of avoiding the rearing of children. (See Southey&rsquo;s
<i>History of Brazil</i>, iii. pp. 402, 673.) Of the wild Indians very
little is known in regard to either numbers or customs.</p>

<p>The white population (231,088) is descended in great part
from the early Spanish adventurers who entered the country in
search of mineral wealth. To these have been added a small
number of Spanish Americans from neighbouring republics and
some Portuguese Americans from Brazil. There has been no
direct immigration from Europe, though Europeans of various
nationalities have found their way into the country and settled
there as miners or traders. The percentage of whites therefore
does not increase as in Argentina and Brazil, and cannot until
means are found to promote European immigration.</p>

<p>The <i>mestizos</i> (486,018) are less numerous than the Indians, but
outnumber the whites by more than two to one. It has been said
of the <i>mestizos</i> elsewhere that they inherit the vices of both races
and the virtues of neither. Yet, with a decreasing Indian
population, and with a white population wanting in energy,
barely able to hold its own and comprising only one-eighth of
the total, the future of Bolivia mainly depends on them. As a
rule they are ignorant, unprogressive and apathetic, intensely
superstitious, cruel and intemperate, though individual strong
characters have been produced. It may be that education and
experience will develop the <i>mestizos</i> into a vigorous progressive
nationality, but the first century of self-government can hardly
be said to have given much promise of such a result.</p>

<p><i>Divisions and Towns</i>.&mdash;The republic is divided into eight
departments and one territory, and these are subdivided into
54 provinces, 415 cantons, 232 vice-cantons, 18 missions and
one colony. The names, areas and populations of the departments,
with their capitals, according to the census of 1900, to
which corrections must be made on account of the loss of territory
to Brazil in 1903, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p>The total area according to Gotha computations, with corrections
for loss of territory to Brazil in 1903, is 515,156 sq. m.</p>

<p>There are no populous towns other than the provincial capitals
above enumerated. Four of these capitals&mdash;Sucré or Chuquisaca,
La Paz, Cochabamba and Oruro&mdash;have served as the national
capital, and Sucré was chosen, but after the revolution of 1898
the capital was at La Paz, which is the commercial metropolis
and is more accessible than Sucré. Among the smaller towns
prominent because of an industry or commercial position, may
be mentioned the Huanchaca mining centre of Pulacayo (pop.
6512), where 3200 men are employed in the mines and surface
works of this great silver mining company; Uyuni (pop. 1587),
the junction of the Pulacayo branch with the Antofagasta and
Oruro railway, and also the converging point for several important
highways and projected railways; and Tupiza (pop. 1644), a
commercial and mining centre near the Argentine frontier, and
the terminus of the Argentine railway extension into Bolivia.
All these towns are in the department of Potosi. Viacha (pop.
1670), a small station on the railway from Guaqui to Alto de La
Paz, 14 m. from the latter, is the starting point of an important
projected railway to Oruro. In the department of Cochabamba,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span>
Tarata (4681) and Totora (3501) are two important trading
centres, and in the department of Santa Cruz, Ascensión (pop.
4784) is a large mission station in the Chiquitos hills.</p>

<p><i>Communications</i>.&mdash;Under a treaty with Brazil in 1903 and with
Chile in 1904 (ratified 1905) provisions were made for railway
construction in Bolivia to bring this isolated region into more
effective communication with the outside world. Brazil agreed
to construct a railway around the falls of the Madeira (about
180 m. long) to give north-eastern Bolivia access to the Amazon,
and paid down £2,000,000 in cash which Bolivia was to expend
on railway construction within her own territory. Chile also
agreed to construct a railway from Arica to La Paz, 295 m. (the
Bolivian section becoming the property of Bolivia fifteen years
after completion), and to pay the interest (not over 5%) which
Bolivia might guarantee on the capital invested in certain interior
railways if constructed within thirty years, providing these
interest payments should not exceed £100,000 a year, nor exceed
£1,600,000 in the aggregate. Argentina had already undertaken
to extend her northern railway from Jujuy to the Bolivian
frontier town of Tupiza, and the Peruvian Corporation had
constructed for the Bolivian government a short line (54 m. long)
from Guaqui, on Lake Titicaca, to Alto de La Paz, which is
connected with the city of La Paz, 1493 ft. below, by an electric
line 5 m. long. This line gives La Paz access to the Peruvian
port of Mollendo, 496 m. distant, and promises in time to give
it railway communication with Cuzco. Rivalry for the control
of her trade, therefore, promises to give Bolivia the railways
needed for the development of her resources. Up to 1903 the
only railways in Bolivia were the Antofagasta and Oruro line,
with a total length of 574 m., of which 350 m. are within Bolivian
territory, a private branch of that line (26 m. long) running to
the Pulacayo mines, and the line (54 m. long) from Guaqui to
Alto de La Paz&mdash;a total of only 430 m. As a result of her war
with Chile in 1878-81, the railways (282 m. long) of her Litoral
department passed under Chilean control. Lines were in 1907
projected from La Paz to the navigable waters of the Beni, from
La Paz to Cochabamba, from Viacha to Oruro, from Uyuni to
Potosi and Sucré, from Uyuni to Tupiza, and from Arica to La
Paz via Corocoro. The central northern line of the Argentine
government was completed to the Bolivian frontier in 1908, and
this line was designed to extend to Tupiza. The undertaking
of the Arica-La Paz line by the Chilean government, also, was
an important step towards the improvement of the economic
situation in Bolivia. Both these lines offer the country new
outlets for its products.</p>

<p>Public highways have been constructed between the large
cities and to some points on the frontiers, and subsidized stage
coaches are run on some of them. The roads are rough and at
times almost impassable, however, and the river crossings
difficult and dangerous. The large cities are connected with one
another by telegraph lines and are in communication with the
outside world through Argentina, Chile and Peru. Telegraph service
dates from 1880, and in 1904 there were 3115 m. in operation,
of which 1936 belonged to the state and 1179 to private corporations.
The latter includes the lines belonging to the Antofagasta
and Oruro railway, which are partly within Chilean territory.
Bolivia is a member of the International Postal Union, and has
parcel and money order conventions with some foreign countries.
Special agreements have been made, also, with Argentina, Chile
and Peru for the transmission of the Bolivian foreign mails.</p>

<p>The loss of her maritime department has left Bolivia with no
other ports than those of Lake Titicaca (especially Guaqui, or
Huaqui, which trades with the Peruvian port of Puno), and those
of the Madeira and Paraguay rivers and their affluents. As
none of these can be reached without transhipment in foreign
territory, the cost of transport is increased, and her neighbours
are enabled to exclude Bolivia from direct commercial intercourse
with other nations. An exception formerly existed at Puerto
Acré, on the Acré river, to which ocean-going steamers could
ascend from Pará, but Brazil first closed the Purús and Acré
rivers to foreign vessels seeking this port, and then under a
treaty of 1903 acquired possession of the port and adjacent
territory. Since then Bolivia&rsquo;s outlet to the Amazon is restricted
to the Madeira river, the navigation of which is interrupted by a
series of falls before Bolivian territory is reached. The Bolivian
port of entry for this trade, Villa Bella, is situated above the
falls of the Madeira at the confluence of the Beni and Mamoré,
and is reached from the lower river by a long and costly portage.
It is also shut off from the navigable rivers above by the falls
of the Beni and Mamoré. The railway to be built by Brazil
will remedy this unfavourable situation, will afford a better
outlet for north-eastern Bolivia, and should promote a more
rapid development of that region, which is covered with an
admirable system of navigable rivers above the falls of the Beni
and Mamoré. Connected with the upper Paraguay are Puerto
Pacheco on Bahia Negra, Puerto Suarez (about 1600 m. from
Buenos Aires by river), on Lake Cáceres, through which passes
the bulk of Bolivian trade in that direction, and Puerto Quijarro,
on Lake Gaiba, a projected port said to be more accessible than
any other in this region. Whenever the trade of southern Bolivia
becomes important enough to warrant the expense of opening a
navigable channel in the Pilcomayo, direct river communication
with Buenos Aires and Montevideo will be possible.</p>

<p><i>Industries</i>.&mdash;Stock-raising was one of the earliest industries
of the country after that of mining. Horses, formerly successfully
raised in certain parts of the north, have not flourished
there since the introduction of a <i>peste</i> from Brazil, but some are
now raised in La Paz and other departments of the temperate
region. The Jesuit founders of the Mojos missions took cattle
with them when they entered that region to labour among the
Indians, with the result that the Mojos and Chiquitos llanos
were soon well stocked, and have since afforded an unfailing
supply of beef for the neighbouring inland markets. Their
inaccessibility and the costs of transportation have prevented
a development of the industry and a consequent improvement
in stock, but the persistency of the industry under conditions
so unfavourable is evidence that the soil and climate are suited
to its requirements. Farther south the llanos of Chuquisaca
and Tarija also sustain large herds of cattle on the more elevated
districts, and on the well-watered plains of the Chaco. There are
small districts in La Paz, Potosi and Cochabamba, also, where
cattle are raised. Apart from the cattle driven into the mining
districts for consumption, a number of <i>saladeros</i> are employed
in preparing (usually salting and sun-drying) beef for the home
markets. The hides are exported. Goats are raised in the warm
and temperate regions, and sheep for their wool in the latter.
On the higher and colder plateaus much attention is given to
the breeding of llamas and alpacas. Another industry of a
different character is that of breeding the fur-bearing chinchilla
(<i>C. laniger</i>), which is a native of the higher plateaus. The
Bolivian government has prohibited the exportation of the live
animals and is encouraging their production.</p>

<p>The agricultural resources of the republic are varied and of
great value, but their development has been slow and hesitating.
The cultivation of cereals, fruits and vegetables in the temperate
and warm valleys of the Andes followed closely the mining
settlements. Sugar-cane also was introduced at an early date,
but as the demand for sugar was limited the product was devoted
chiefly to the manufacture of rum, which is the principal object
of cane cultivation in Bolivia to-day. The climatic conditions
are highly favourable for this product in eastern Bolivia, but
it is heavily taxed and is restricted to a small home market.
Rice is another exotic grown in the tropical districts of eastern
Bolivia, but the quantity produced is far from sufficient to meet
local requirements. Tobacco of a fair quality is produced in
the warm regions of the east, including the <i>yungas</i> valleys of
La Paz and Cochabamba; cacáo of a superior grade is grown
in the department of Beni, where large orchards were planted
at the missions, and also in the warm Andean valleys of La Paz
and Cochabamba; and coffee of the best flavour is grown in
some of the warmer districts of the eastern Andes. The two
indigenous products which receive most attention, perhaps, are
those of quinoa and coca. Quinoa is grown in large quantities,
and is a staple article of food among the natives. Coca is highly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span>
esteemed by the natives, who masticate the leaf, and is also an
article of export for medicinal purposes. It is extensively cultivated
in the departments of Cochabamba and La Paz, especially
in the province of Yungas.</p>

<p>In the exploitation of her forest products, however, are to be
found the industries that yield the greatest immediate profit to
Bolivia. The most prominent and profitable of these is that of
rubber-collecting, which was begun in Bolivia between 1880 and
1890, and which reached a registered annual output of nearly
3500 metric tons just before Bolivia&rsquo;s best rubber forests were
transferred to Brazil in 1903. There still remain extensive areas
of forest on the Beni and Madre de Dios in which the rubber-producing
<i>Hevea</i> is to be found. Although representing less
value in the aggregate, the collecting of cinchona bark is one of
the oldest forest industries of Bolivia, which is said still to have
large areas of virgin forest to draw upon. The Bolivian product
is of the best because of the high percentage of quinine
sulphate which it yields. The industry is destructive in method,
and the area of cinchona forests is steadily diminishing. Many
other Bolivian plants are commercially valuable, and organized
industry and trade in them will certainly be profitable.</p>

<p>The industrial activities of the Bolivian people are still of a
very primitive character. An act was passed in 1894 authorizing
the government to offer premiums and grant advantageous
concessions for the development of manufacturing industries,
especially in sugar production, but conditions have not been
favourable and the results have been disappointing. Spinning
and weaving are carried on among the people as a household
occupation, and fabrics are made of an exceptionally substantial
character. It is not uncommon to see the natives busily twirling
their rude spindles as they follow their troops of pack animals
over rough mountain roads, and the yarn produced is woven
into cloth in their own houses on rough Spanish looms of colonial
patterns. Not only is coarse cloth for their own garments made
in this manner from the fleece of the llama, but cotton and
woollen goods of a serviceable character are manufactured, and
still finer fabrics are woven from the wool of the alpaca and
vicuña, sometimes mixed with silk or lamb&rsquo;s wool. The Indian
women are expert weavers, and their handiwork often commands
high prices. In the Mojos and Chiquitos districts the natives
were taught by the Jesuit missionaries to weave an excellent
cotton cloth, and the industry still exists. Cashmere, baize,
waterproof <i>ponchos</i> of fine wool and silk, and many other fabrics
are made by the Indians of the Andean departments. They are
skilled in the use of dyes, and the Indian women pride themselves
on a large number of finely-woven, brilliantly-coloured petticoats.
Tanning and saddlery are carried on by the natives with primitive
methods, but with excellent results. They are skilful in the
preparation of lap robes and rugs from the skins of the alpaca
and vicuña. The home markets are supplied, by native industry,
with cigars and cigarettes, soap, candles, hats, gloves, starch,
cheese and pottery. Sugar is still made in the old way, and there
is a small production of wine and silk in certain districts. No
country is better supplied with water power, and electric lighting
and electric power plants have been established at La Paz.</p>

<p><i>Commerce</i>.&mdash;The foreign trade of Bolivia is comparatively
unimportant, but the statistical returns are incomplete and unsatisfactory;
the imports of 1904 aggregated only £1,734,551
in value, and the exports only £1,851,758. The imports consisted
of cottons, woollens, live-stock, provisions, hardware and
machinery, wines, spirits and clothing. The principal exports
were (in 1903) silver and its ores (£636,743), tin and its ores
(£1,039,298), copper ores (£157,609), bismuth (£16,354), other
minerals (£20,948), rubber (£260,559), coca (£28,907), and cinchona
(£9197)&mdash;total exports, £2,453,638. These figures, however,
do not correctly represent the aggregates of Bolivian trade, as
her imports and exports passing through Antofagasta, Arica
and Mollendo are to a large extent credited to Chile and Peru.
The import trade of Bolivia is restricted by the poverty of the
people. The geographical position limits the exports to mineral,
forest and some pastoral products, owing to cost of transportation
and the tariffs of neighbouring countries.</p>

<p><i>Government</i>.&mdash;The government of Bolivia is a &ldquo;unitarian&rdquo; or
centralized republic, representative in form, but autocratic in
some important particulars. The constitution in force (1908)
was adopted on the 28th of October 1880, and is a model in form
and profession. The executive branch of the government is
presided over by a president and two vice-presidents, who are
elected by direct popular vote for a period of four years, and are
not eligible for re-election for the next succeeding term. The
president is assisted by a cabinet of five ministers of state, viz.:
foreign relations and worship; finance and industry; interior
and fomento; justice and public instruction; war and colonization.
Every executive act must be countersigned by a minister
of state, who is held responsible for its character and enforcement,
and may be prosecuted before the supreme court for its illegality
and effects. The legislative branch is represented by a national
congress of two houses&mdash;a Senate and Chamber of Deputies.
The Senate is composed of 16 members, two from each department,
who are elected by direct popular vote for a period of six
years, one-third retiring every two years. The Chamber of
Deputies is composed of 72 members, who are elected for a period
of four years, one-half retiring every two years. In impeachment
trials the Chamber prosecutes and the Senate sits as a court, as
in the United States. One of the duties of the Chamber is to
elect the justices of the supreme court. Congress meets annually
and its sessions are for sixty days, which may be extended to
ninety days. The chambers have separate and concurrent powers
defined by the constitution. The right of suffrage is exercised by
all male citizens, twenty-one years of age, or over, if single, and
eighteen years, or over, if married, who can read and write, and
own real estate or have an income of 200 bolivianos a year,
said income not to be compensation for services as a servant.
The electoral body is therefore small, and is under the control of a
political oligarchy which practically rules the country, no matter
which party is in power.</p>

<p>The Bolivian judiciary consists of a national supreme court,
eight superior district courts, lower district courts, and <i>juzgados
de instrucción</i> for the investigation and preparation of cases.
The <i>corregidores</i> and <i>alcaldes</i> also exercise the functions of a
justice of the peace in the cantons and rural districts. The
supreme court is composed of seven justices elected by the
Chamber of Deputies from lists of three names for each seat sent
in by the Senate. A justice can be removed only by impeachment
proceedings before the Senate.</p>

<p>The supreme administration in each department is vested in a
prefect appointed by and responsible solely to the president.
As the prefect has the appointment of subordinate department
officials, including the <i>alcaldes</i>, the authority of the national
executive reaches every hamlet in the republic, and may easily
become autocratic. There are no legislative assemblies in the
departments, and their government rests with the national
executive and congress. Subordinate to the prefects are the sub-prefects
in the provinces, the <i>corregidores</i> in the cantons and
the <i>alcaldes</i> in the rural districts&mdash;all appointed officials. The
national territory adjacent to Brazil and Peru is governed by two
<i>delegados nacionales</i>, appointees of the president. The department
capitals are provided with municipal councils which have
jurisdiction over certain local affairs, and over the construction
and maintenance of some of the highways.</p>

<p><i>Army</i>.&mdash;The military forces of the republic in 1905 included
2890 regulars and an enrolled force of 80,000 men, divided into a
first reserve of 30,000, a second reserve of 40,000, and 10,000
territorial guards. The enrolled force is, however, both unorganized
and unarmed. The strength of the army is fixed in
each year&rsquo;s budget. That for 1903 consisted of 2933 officers and
men, of which 275 were commissioned and 558 non-commissioned
officers, 181 musicians, and only 1906 rank and file. A conscription
law of 1894 provides for a compulsory military service
between the ages of twenty-one and fifty years, with two
years&rsquo; actual service in the regulars for those between twenty-one
and twenty-five, but the law is practically a dead letter.
There is a military school with 60 cadets, and an arsenal at
La Paz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>174</span></p>

<p><i>Education</i>.&mdash;Although Bolivia has a free and compulsory
school system, education and the provision for education have
made little progress. Only a small percentage of the people
can read and write. Although Spanish is the language of
the dominant minority, Quichua, Aymará and Guarani are the
languages of the natives, who form a majority of the population.
A considerable percentage of the Indians do not understand
Spanish at all, and they even resist every effort to force it upon
them. Even the <i>cholos</i> (mestizos) are more familiar with the
native idioms than with Spanish, as is the case in some parts of
Argentina and Paraguay. According to official estimates for
1901, the total number of primary schools in the republic was 733,
with 938 teachers and 41,587 pupils&mdash;the total cost of their
maintenance being estimated at 585,365 bolivianos, or only 14.07
bolivianos per pupil (about £1 : 4 : 6). The school enrolment
was only one in 43.7 of population, compared with one in 10 for
Argentina. The schools are largely under the control of the
municipalities, though nearly half of them are maintained by the
national government, by the Church and by private means.
There were in the same year 13 institutions of secondary and
14 of superior instruction. The latter include so-called universities
at Sucré (Chuquisaca), La Paz, Cochabamba, Tarija,
Potosi, Santa Cruz and Oruro&mdash;all of which give instruction in
law, the first three in medicine and the first four in theology.
The university at Sucré, which dates from colonial times, and
that at La Paz, are the only ones on the list sufficiently well
equipped to merit the title. Secondary instruction is under the
control of the universities, and public instruction in general is
under the direction of a cabinet minister. All educational
matters, however, are practically under the supervision of the
Church. The total appropriation for educational purposes in
1901 was 756,943 bolivianos, or £66,232 : 6s. There are a military
academy at La Paz, an agricultural school at Umala in the department
of La Paz, a mining and civil engineering school at Oruro,
commercial schools at Sucré and Trinidad, and several mission
schools under the direction of religious orders.</p>

<p><i>Religion</i>.&mdash;The constitution of Bolivia, art. 2, defines the
attitude of the republic toward the Church in the following
words:&mdash;&ldquo;The state recognizes and supports the Roman
Apostolic Catholic religion, the public exercise of any other
worship being prohibited, except in the colonies where it is
tolerated.&rdquo; This toleration is tacitly extended to resident
foreigners belonging to other religious sects. The census of 1900
enumerated the Roman Catholic population at 1,609,365, and
that of other creeds at 24,245, which gives the former 985 and the
latter 15 in every thousand. The domesticated Indians profess
the Roman Catholic faith, but it is tinged with the superstitions of
their ancestors. They hold the clergy in great fear and reverence,
however, and are deeply influenced by the forms and ceremonies
of the church, which have changed little since the first Spanish
settlements. Bolivia is divided into an archbishopric and three
bishoprics. The first includes the departments of Chuquisaca,
Oruro, Potosi, Tarija and the Chilean province of Antofagasta,
with its seat at Sucré, and is known as the archbishopric of La
Plata. The sees of the three bishoprics are La Paz, Cochabamba
and Santa Cruz. Mission work among the Indians is entrusted to
the <i>Propaganda Fide</i>, which has five colleges and a large number
of missions, and receives a small subvention from the state. It is
estimated that these missions have charge of fully 20,000 Indians.
The annual appropriation for the Church is about £17,150. The
religious orders, which have never been suppressed in Bolivia,
maintain several convents.</p>

<p><i>Finance</i>.&mdash;No itemized returns of receipts and expenditures
are ever published, and the estimates presented to congress by
the cabinet ministers furnish the only source from which information
can be drawn. The expenditures are not large, and
taxation is not considered heavy. The estimated revenues and
expenditures for 1904 and 1905 at 21 pence per boliviano,
were as follows: 1904, revenue £632,773 : 15s., expenditure
£748,571 : 10s.; 1905, revenue £693,763 : 17 : 6, expenditure
£828,937 : 19 : 9. The revenues are derived principally from
duties and fees on imports, excise taxes on spirits, wines, tobacco
and sugar, general, mining taxes and export duties on minerals
(except silver), export duties on rubber and coca, taxes on the
profits of stock companies, fees for licences and patents, stamp
taxes, and postal and telegraph revenues. Nominally, the
import duties are moderate, so much so that Bolivia is sometimes
called a &ldquo;free-trade country,&rdquo; but this is a misnomer, for in
addition to the schedule rates of 10 to 40% <i>ad valorem</i> on imports,
there are a consular fee of 1½% for the registration of
invoices exceeding 200 bolivianos, a consumption tax of 10
centavos per quintal (46 kilogrammes), fees for viséing certificates
to accompany merchandise in transit, special &ldquo;octroi&rdquo;
taxes on certain kinds of merchandise controlled by monopolies
(spirits, tobacco, &amp;c.), and the import and consumption taxes
levied by the departments and municipalities. The expenditures
are chiefly for official salaries, subsidies, public works, church
and mission support, justice, public instruction, military expenses,
and interest on the public debt. The appropriations for
1905 were as follows: war, 2,081,119 bolivianos; finance and
industry, 1,462,259; government and fomento, 2,021,428;
justice and public instruction, 1,878,941.</p>

<p>The acknowledged public debt of the country is comparatively
small. At the close of the war with Chile there was an indemnity
debt due to citizens of that republic of 6,550,830
bolivianos, which had been nearly liquidated in 1904 when Chile
took over the unpaid balance. This was Bolivia&rsquo;s only foreign
debt. In 1905 her internal debt, including 1,998,500 bolivianos
of treasury bills, amounted to 6,243,270 bolivianos (£546,286).
The government in 1903 authorized the issue of treasury notes
for the department of Beni and the National Territory to the
amount of one million bolivianos (£87,500), for the redemption
of which 10% of the customs receipts of the two districts is set
apart. The paper currency of the republic consists of bank-notes
issued by four private banks, and is therefore no part of the
public debt. The amount in circulation on the 30th of June
1903 was officially estimated at 9,144,254 bolivianos (£800,122),
issued on a par with silver. The coinage of the country is of
silver, nickel and copper. The silver coins are of the denominations
of 1 boliviano, or 100 centavos, 50, 20, 10 and 5 centavos,
and the issue of these coins from the Potosi mint is said to be
about 1,500,000 bolivianos a year. The silver mining companies
are required by law to send to the mint 20% of their
product. The silver boliviano, however, is rarely seen in circulation
because of the cheaper paper currency. To check the
exportation of silver coin, the fractional denominations have
been slightly debased. The nickel coins are of 5 and 10 centavos,
and the copper 1 and 2 centavos.</p>

<p>The departmental revenues, which are derived from excise and
land taxes, mining grants, tithes, inheritance taxes, tolls, stamp
taxes, subsidies from the national treasury and other small
taxes, were estimated at 2,296,172 bolivianos in 1903, and the
expenditures at 2,295,791 bolivianos. The expenditures were
chiefly for justice, police, public works, public instruction and
the Church. The municipal revenues aggregated 2,317,670
bolivianos in 1902, and the expenditures 61,510 bolivianos in
excess of that sum. These revenues are derived from a lighting
tax, leases and ground rents, cemetery fees, consumption and
market taxes, licences, tolls, taxes on hides and skins, personal
and various minor taxes. There is a multiplication of taxes
in trade which recalls the old colonial <i>alcabala</i> tax, and it serves
to restrict commerce and augment the cost of goods in much the
same way, if not to the same degree.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">History</p>

<p>The country now forming the republic of Bolivia, named after
the great liberator Simon Bolivar (<i>q.v.</i>), was in early days simply
a portion of the empire of the Incas of Peru (<i>q.v.</i>). After the
conquest of Peru by the Spaniards in the 16th century the natives
were subjected to much tyranny and oppression, though it must
in fairness be said that much of it was carried out in defiance
of the efforts and the wishes of the Spanish home government,
whose legislative efforts to protect the Indians from serfdom and
ill-usage met with scant respect at the hands of the distant
settlers and mine-owners, who bid defiance to the humane and
protective regulations of the council of the Indies, and treated
the unhappy natives little better than beasts of burden. The
statement, moreover, that some eight millions of Indians perished
through forced labour in the mines is a gross exaggeration. The
annual diminution in the number of the Indian population was
undoubtedly very great, but it was due far more to the result of
European epidemics and to indulgence in alcohol than to hard
work. The abortive insurrection of 1780-82, led by the Inca
Tupac Amarú, was never a general rising, and was directed rather
against Creole tyranny than against Spanish rule. The heavy
losses sustained by the Indians during that outbreak, and their
dislike and distrust of the colonial Spaniard, account for the
comparative indifference with which they viewed the rise and
progress of the 1814 colonial revolt against Spain, which gave
the South American states their independence.</p>

<p>We are only concerned here with the War of Independence so
far as it affected Upper Peru, the Bolivia of later days. When
the patriots of Buenos Aires had succeeded in liberating
from the dominion of Spain the interior provinces of
<span class="sidenote">War of Independence.</span>
the Rio de la Plata, they turned their arms against
their enemies who held Upper Peru. An almost uninterrupted
warfare followed, from July 1809 till August 1825,
with alternate successes on the side of the Spanish or royalist
and the South American or patriot forces,&mdash;the scene of action
lying chiefly between the Argentine provinces of Salta and Jujuy
and the shores of Lake Titicaca. The first movement of the
war was the successful invasion of Upper Peru by the army of
Buenos Aires, under General Balcarce, which, after twice defeating
the Spanish troops, was able to celebrate the first anniversary
of independence near Lake Titicaca, in May 1811. Soon,
however, the patriot army, owing to the dissolute conduct and
negligence of its leaders, became disorganized, and was attacked
and defeated, in June 1811, by the Spanish army under Gey fol
Goyeneche, and driven back into Jujuy. Four years of warfare,
in which victory was alternately with the Spaniards and the
patriots, was terminated in 1815 by the total rout of the latter
in a battle which took place between Potosi and Oruro. To this
succeeded a revolt of the Indians of the southern provinces of
Peru, and the object being the independence of the whole
country, it was joined by numerous Creoles. This insurrection
was, however, speedily put down by the royalists. In 1816 the
Spanish general Laserna, having been appointed commander-in-chief
of Upper Peru, made an attempt to invade the Argentine
provinces, intending to march on Buenos Aires, but he was
completely foiled in this by the activity of the irregular <i>gaucho</i>
troops of Salta and Jujuy, and was forced to retire. During this
time and in the six succeeding years a guerrilla warfare was
maintained by the patriots of Upper Peru, who had taken refuge
in the mountains, chiefly of the province of Yungas, and who
frequently harassed the royalist troops. In June 1823 the
expedition of General Santa Cruz, prepared with great zeal and
activity at Lima, marched in two divisions upon Upper Peru, and
in the following months of July and August the whole country
between La Paz and Oruro was occupied by his forces; but
later, the indecision and want of judgment displayed by Santa
Cruz allowed a retreat to be made before a smaller royalist army,
and a severe storm converted their retreat into a precipitate
flight, only a remnant of the expedition again reaching Lima.
In 1824, after the great battle of Ayacucho in Lower Peru,
General Sucre, whose valour had contributed so much to the
patriot success of that day, marched with a part of the victorious
army into Upper Peru. On the news of the victory a universal
rising of the patriots took place, and before Sucre had reached
Oruro and Puno, in February 1825, La Paz was already in their
possession, and the royalist garrisons of several towns had gone
over to their side. The Spanish general Olañeta, with a diminished
army of 2000 men, was confined to the province of Potosi, where
he held out till March 1825, when he was mortally wounded in
an action with some of his own revolted troops.</p>

<p>General Sucre was now invested with the supreme command
in Upper Peru, until the requisite measures could be taken to
establish in that country a regular and constitutional government.
Deputies from the various provinces to the number of fifty-four
were assembled at Chuquisaca, the capital, to decide upon the
question proposed to them on the part of the government of
the Argentine provinces, whether they would or would not remain
separate from that country. In August 1825 they decided this
<span class="sidenote">Bolivia a nation.</span>
question, declaring it to be the national will that Upper
Peru should in future constitute a distinct and independent
nation. This assembly continued their session,
although the primary object of their meeting had thus been
accomplished, and afterwards gave the name of Bolivia to the
country,&mdash;issuing at the same time a formal declaration of
independence.</p>

<p>The first general assembly of deputies of Bolivia dissolved
itself on the 6th of October 1825, and a new congress was summoned
and formally installed at Chuquisaca on the 25th of May
1826, to take into consideration the constitution prepared by
Bolivar for the new republic. A favourable report was made
to that body by a committee appointed to examine it, on which
it was approved by the congress, and declared to be the constitution
of the republic; and as such, it was sworn to by the people.
General Sucre was chosen president for life, according to the
constitution, but only accepted the appointment for the space
of two years, and on the express condition that 2000 Colombian
troops should be permitted to remain with him.</p>

<p>The independence of the country, so dearly bought, did not,
however, secure for it a peaceful future. Repeated risings
occurred, till in the end of 1827 General Sucre and his Colombian
troops were driven from La Paz. A new congress was formed
at Chuquisaca in April 1828, which modified the constitution
given by Bolivar, and chose Marshal Santa Cruz for president; but
only a year later a revolution, led by General Blanco, threw the
country into disorder and for a time overturned the government.
Quiet being again restored in 1831, Santa Cruz promulgated
the code of laws which bore his name, and brought the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>176</span>
financial affairs of the country into some order; he also concluded
a treaty of commerce with Peru, and for several years
Bolivia remained in peace. In 1835, when a struggle for the
chief power had made two factions in the neighbouring republic
of Peru, Santa Cruz was induced to take a part in the contest;
he marched into that country, and after defeating General
Gamarra, the leader of one of the opposing parties, completed
the pacification of Peru in the spring of 1836, named himself
its protector, and had in view a confederation of the two countries.
At this juncture the government of Chile interfered actively,
and espousing the cause of Gamarra, sent troops into Peru.
Three years of fighting ensued till in a battle at Jungay in June
1839 Santa Cruz was defeated and exiled, Gamarra became
president of Peru, and General Velasco provisional chief in Bolivia.
The Santa Cruz party, however, remained strong in Bolivia,
and soon revolted successfully against the new head of the
government, ultimately installing General Ballivian in the
chief power. Taking advantage of the disturbed condition of
Bolivia, Gamarra made an attempt to annex the rich province
of La Paz, invading it in August 1841 and besieging the capital;
but in a battle with Ballivian his army was totally routed, and
Gamarra himself was killed. The Bolivian general was now in
turn to invade Peru, when Chile again interfered to prevent him.
Ballivian remained in the presidency till 1848, when he retired
to Valparaiso, and in the end of that year General Belzu, after
leading a successful military revolution, took the chief power,
and during his presidency endeavoured to promote agriculture,
industry and trade. General Jorge Cordova succeeded him,
but had not been long in office when a new revolt in September
1857, originating with the garrison of Oruro, spread over the
land, and compelled him to quit the country. His place was
taken by Dr José Maria Linares, the originator of the revolution,
who, taking into his own hands all the powers of government,
and acting with the greatest severity, caused himself to be
proclaimed dictator in March 1858. Fresh disturbances led
to the deposition of Linares in 1861, when Dr Maria de Acha was
chosen president. In 1862 a treaty of peace and commerce with
the United States was ratified, and in the following year a
similar treaty was concluded with Belgium; but new causes of
disagreement with Chile had arisen in the discovery of rich beds
of guano on the eastern coast-land of the desert of Atacama,
which threatened warfare, and were only set at rest by the
treaty of August 1866, in which the 24th parallel of latitude
was adopted as the boundary between the two republics. A new
military revolution, led by Maria Melgarejo, broke out in 1865,
and in February of that year the troops of President Acha were
defeated in a battle near Potosi, when Melgarejo took the
dominion of the country. After defeating two revolutions, in
1865 and 1866, the new president declared a political amnesty,
and in 1869, after imposing a revised constitution on the country,
he became its dictator.</p>

<p>In January 1871 President Melgarejo was in his turn deposed
and driven from the country by a revolution headed by Colonel
Augustin Morales. The latter, becoming president,
was himself murdered in November 1872 and was
<span class="sidenote">Recent history.</span>
succeeded by Colonel Adolfo Ballivian, who died in
1874. Under this president Bolivia entered upon a secret agreement
with Peru which was destined to have grave consequences
for both countries. To understand the reasons that urged
Bolivia to take this step it is necessary to go back to the above-mentioned
treaty of 1866 between Chile and Bolivia. By this
instrument Bolivia, besides conceding the 24th parallel as the
boundary of Chilean territory, agreed that Chile should have a
half share of the customs and full facilities for trading on the
coast that lay between the 23rd and 24th parallels, Chile at that
time being largely interested in the trade of that region. It was
also agreed that Chile should be allowed to mine and export the
products of this district without tax or hindrance on the part of
Bolivia. In 1870, in further consideration of the sum of $10,000,
Bolivia granted to an Anglo-Chilean company the right of working
certain nitrate deposits north of the 24th parallel. The great
wealth which was passing into Chilean hands owing to these
compacts created no little discontent in Bolivia, nor was Peru
any better pleased with the hold that Chilean capital was establishing
in the rich district of Tarapacá. On 6th February 1873
Bolivia entered upon a secret agreement with Peru, the ostensible
object of which was the preservation of their territorial integrity
and their mutual defence against exterior aggression. There can
be no doubt that the aggression contemplated as possible by
both countries was a further encroachment on the part of Chile.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Adolfo Ballivian, immediately after the
conclusion of this treaty with Peru, Dr Tomas Frias succeeded
to the presidency. He signed yet another treaty with Chile, by
which the latter agreed to withdraw her claim to half the duties
levied in Bolivian ports on condition that all Chilean industries
established in Bolivian territory should be free from duty for
twenty-five years. This treaty was never ratified, and four years
later General Hilarion Daza, who had succeeded Dr Frias as
president in 1876, demanded as the price of Bolivia&rsquo;s consent
that a tax of 10 cents per quintal should be paid on all nitrates
exported from the country, further declaring that, unless this
levy was paid, nitrates in the hands of the exporters would be
seized by the Bolivian government. As an answer to these demands,
and in order to protect the property of Chilean subjects,
the Chilean fleet was sent to blockade the ports of Antofagasta,
Cobija and Tocapilla. On the 14th February 1879 the Chilean
colonel Sotomayor occupied Antofagasta, and on 1st March,
a fortnight later, the Bolivian government declared war.</p>

<p>An offer on the part of Peru to act as mediator met with no
favour from Chile. The existence of the secret treaty, well
known to the Chilean government, rendered the intervention of
Peru more than questionable, and the law passed by the latter
in 1875, which practically created a monopoly of the Tarapacá
nitrate beds to the serious prejudice of Chilean enterprise, offered
no guarantee of her good faith. Chile replied by curtly demanding
the annulment of the secret treaty and an assurance of Peruvian
neutrality. Both demands being refused, she declared war upon
Peru.</p>

<p>The superiority of the Chileans at sea, though checked for
some time by the heroic gallantry of the Peruvians, soon enabled
them to land a sufficient number of troops to meet the allied
forces which had concentrated at Arica and other points in the
south. The Bolivian ports were already in Chilean hands, and
a sea attack upon Pisagua surprised and routed the troops under
the Peruvian general Buendia and opened the way into the
southern territory of Peru. General Daza, who should have cooperated
with Buendia, turned back, on receiving news of the
Peruvian defeat, and led the Bolivian troops to Tacna in a hasty
and somewhat disorderly retreat. The fall of San Francisco
followed, and Iquique, which was evacuated by the allies without
a struggle, was occupied. Severe fighting took place before
Tarapacá surrendered, but the end of 1879 saw the Chileans in
complete possession of the province.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a double revolution took place in Peru and Bolivia.
In the former country General Prado was deposed and Colonel
Pierola proclaimed dictator. The Bolivians followed the example
of their allies. The troops at Tacna, indignant at the inglorious
part they had been condemned to play by the incompetence or
cowardice of their president, deprived him of their command and
elected Colonel Camacho to lead them. At the same time a
revolution in La Paz proclaimed General Narciso Campero president,
and he was elected to that post in the following June by
the ordinary procedure of the constitution. During 1880 the
war was chiefly maintained at sea between Chile and Peru,
Bolivia taking little or no part in the struggle. In January of
1881 were fought the battles of Chorillos and Miraflores, attended
by heavy slaughter and savage excesses on the part of the Chilean
troops. They were followed almost immediately by the surrender
of Lima and Callao, which left the Chileans practically masters
of Peru. In the interior, however, where the Peruvian admiral
Montero had formed a provisional government, the war still
lingered, and in September 1882 a conference took place between
the latter and President Campero, at which it was decided that
they should hold out for better terms. But the Peruvians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span>
wearied of the useless struggle. On the 20th of October 1883
they concluded a treaty of peace with Chile; the troops at Arequipa,
under Admiral Montero, surrendered that town, and
Montero himself, coldly received in Bolivia, whither he had fled
for refuge, withdrew from the country to Europe. On the 9th
of November the Chilean army of occupation was concentrated
at Arequipa, while what remained of the Bolivian army lay at
Oruro. Negotiations were opened, and on 11th December a
peace was signed between Chile and Bolivia. By this treaty
Bolivia ceded to Chile the whole of its sea-coast, including the
port of Cobija.</p>

<p>On the 18th of May 1895 a treaty was signed at Santiago
between Chile and Bolivia, &ldquo;with a view to strengthening the
bonds of friendship which unite the two countries,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;in
accord with the higher necessity that the future development
and commercial prosperity of Bolivia require her free access to
the sea.&rdquo; By this treaty Chile declared that if, in consequence
of the plebiscite (to take place under the treaty of Ancon with
Peru), or by virtue of direct arrangement, she should &ldquo;acquire
dominion and permanent sovereignty over the territories of
Tacna and Arica, she undertakes to transfer them to Bolivia
in the same form and to the same extent as she may acquire
them&rdquo;; the republic of Bolivia paying as an indemnity for that
transfer $5,000,000 silver. If this cession should be effected,
Chile should advance her own frontier north of Camerones to
Vitor, from the sea up to the frontier which actually separates
that district from Bolivia. Chile also pledged herself to use her
utmost endeavour, either separately or jointly with Bolivia, to
obtain possession of Tacna and Arica. If she failed, she bound
herself to cede to Bolivia the roadstead (<i>caleta</i>) of Vitor, or
another analogous one, and $5,000,000 silver. Supplementary
protocols to this treaty stipulated that the port to be ceded must
&ldquo;fully satisfy the present and future requirements&rdquo; of the
commerce of Bolivia.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of May 1895 further treaties of peace and commerce
were signed with Chile, but the provisions with regard
to the cession of a seaport to Bolivia still remained unfulfilled.
During those ten years of recovery on the part of Bolivia from
the effects of the war, the presidency was held by Dr Pacheco,
who succeeded Campero, and held office for the full term; by
Dr Aniceto Arce, who held it until 1892, and by Dr Mariano
Baptista, his successor. In 1896 Dr Severe Alonso became
president, and during his tenure of office diplomatic relations
were resumed with Great Britain, Señor Aramayo being sent
to London as minister plenipotentiary in July 1897. As an
outcome of his mission an extradition treaty was concluded with
Great Britain in March 1898.</p>

<p>In December an attempt was made to pass a law creating
Sucre the perpetual capital of the republic. Until this Sucre
had taken its turn with La Paz, Cochabamba and Oruro. La
Paz rose in open revolt. On the 17th of January of the following
year a battle was fought some 40 m. from La Paz between the
insurgents and the government forces, in which the latter were
defeated with the loss of a colonel and forty-three men. Colonel
Pando, the insurgent leader, having gained a strong following,
marched upon Oruro, and entered that town on 11th April 1899,
after completely defeating the government troops. Dr Severo
Alonso took refuge in Chilean territory; and Colonel Pando
formed a provisional government. He had no difficulty in
obtaining his election to the presidency without opposition. He
entered upon office on the 26th of October, and proved himself
to be a strong and capable chief magistrate. He had to deal
with two difficult settlements as to boundaries with Chile and
Brazil, and to take steps for improving the means of communication
in the country, by this means reviving its mining and other
industries. The dispute with Brazil over the rich Acré rubber-producing
territory was accentuated by the majority of those
engaged in the rubber industry being Brazilians, who resented
the attempts of Bolivian officials to exercise authority in the
district. This led to a declaration of independence on the part
of the state of Acré, and the despatch of a body of Bolivian
troops in 1900 to restore order. There was no desire, however,
on the part of President Pando to involve himself in hostilities
with Brazil, and in a spirit of concession the dispute was settled
amicably by diplomatic means, and a treaty signed in November
1903. A new boundary line was drawn, and a portion of the
Acré province ceded to Brazil in consideration of a cash indemnity
of $10,000,000.</p>

<p>The long-standing dispute with Chile with regard to its occupation
of the former Bolivian provinces of Tacna and Arica under
the Parto de Tregna of the 4th of April 1884 was more difficult
to arrange satisfactorily. In 1895 there had been some prospect
of Chile conceding an outlet on the sea in exchange for a recognition
of the Chilean ownership of Tacna and Arica. The discovery,
however, of secret negotiations between Bolivia and Argentina
caused Chile to change its conciliatory attitude. Bolivia was
in no position to venture upon hostilities or to compel the
Chileans to make concessions, and the final settlement of the
boundary dispute between Argentina and Chile deprived the
Bolivians of the hope of obtaining the support of the Argentines.
President Pando and his successor, Ismail Montes, who became
president in 1904, saw that it was necessary to yield, and to make
the best terms they could. A treaty was accordingly ratified
in 1905, which was in many ways advantageous to Bolivia,
though the republic was compelled to cede to Chile the maritime
provinces occupied by the latter power since the war of 1881,
and to do without a seaport. The government of Chile undertook
to construct a railway at its own cost from Arica to the Bolivian
capital, La Paz, and to give the Bolivians free transit through
Chilean territory to certain towns on the coast. Chile further
agreed to pay Bolivia a cash indemnity and lend certain pecuniary
assistance to the construction of other railways necessary for
the opening out of the country.</p>

in &ldquo;bowl,&rdquo; a round vessel for liquids, a variant due to
&ldquo;bowl,&rdquo; ball, which is from the Fr. <i>boule</i>. &ldquo;Boll&rdquo; is also used,
chiefly in Scotland and the north of England, as a measure of
weight for flour = 140 &#8468;, and of capacity for grain: 16 pecks

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOLLANDISTS,<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> the Belgian Jesuits who publish the <i>Acta
Sanctorum</i>, the great collection of biographies and legends of the
saints, arranged by days, in the order of the calendar. The
original idea was conceived by a Jesuit father, Heribert Rosweyde
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hagiology</a></span>), and was explained by him in a sort of prospectus,
which he issued in 1607 under the title of <i>Fasti sanctorum
quorum vitae in Belgicis Bibliothecis manuscriptae</i>. His intention
was to publish in eighteen volumes the lives of the saints compiled
from the MSS., at the same time adding sober notes. At
the time of his death (1629) he had collected a large amount of
material, but had not been able actually to begin the work. A
Jesuit father, John Bolland, was appointed to carry on the project,
and was sent to Antwerp. He continued to amass material,
and extended the scope of the work. In 1643 the two volumes
for January appeared. The three volumes for February appeared
in 1658, the three for March in 1668, the three for April in
1675, and so on. In 1635 Henschenius (Godfried Henschen) was
associated with Bolland, and collaborated in the work until 1681.
From 1659 to 1714 Papebroch (Daniel van Papenbroeck) collaborated.
This was the most brilliant period in the history of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span>
<i>Acta Sanctorum</i>. The freedom of Papebroch&rsquo;s criticism made
him many enemies, and he had often to defend himself against
their attacks. The work was continued&mdash;with some inequalities,
but always in the same spirit&mdash;until the suppression of the Society
of Jesus in 1773. The last volume published was vol. iii. of
October, which appeared in 1770.</p>

<p>On the dispersion of the Jesuits the Bollandists were authorized
to continue their work, and remained at Antwerp until 1778,
when they were transferred to Brussels, to the monastery of
canons regular of Coudenberg. Here they published vol. iv. of
October in 1780, and vol. v. of October in 1786, when the
monastery of Coudenberg was suppressed. In 1788 the work
of the Bollandists ceased. The remains of their library were
acquired by the Premonstratensians of Tongerloo, who endeavoured
to continue the work, and in their abbey vol. vi. of
October appeared in 1794.</p>

<p>After the re-establishment of the Society of Jesus in Belgium
the work was again taken up in 1837, at the suggestion of
the Académie Royale of Belgium and with the support of the
Belgian government, and the Bollandists were installed at the
college of St Michael in Brussels. In 1845 appeared vol. vii. of
October, the first of the new series, which reached vol. xiii. of
October in 1883. In this series the Jesuit fathers Joseph van der
Moere, Joseph van Hecke, Benjamin Bossue, Victor and Remi de
Buck, Ant. Tinnebroeck, Edu. Carpentier and Henr. Matagne
collaborated. Father John Martinov of Theazan was entrusted
with the editing of the <i>Annus Graeco-Slavicus</i>, which appeared in
the beginning of vol. xi. of October in 1864.</p>

<p>In 1882 the activities of the Bollandists were exerted in a new
direction, with a view to bringing the work more into line with
the progress of historical methods. A quarterly review was
established under the title of <i>Analecta Bollandiana</i> by the Jesuit
fathers C. de Smedt, G. van Hooff and J. de Backer. This
reached its 25th volume in 1906, and was edited by the
Bollandists de Smedt, F. van Ontroy, H. Delehaye, A. Porcelet
and P. Peeters. This review contains studies in preparation for
the continuation and remoulding of the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i>, inedited
texts, dissertations, and, since 1892, a <i>Bulletin des publications
hagiographiques</i>, containing criticisms of recent works on hagiographic
questions. In addition to this review, the Bollandists
undertook the analysis of the hagiographic MSS. in the principal
libraries. Besides numerous library catalogues published in the
<i>Analecta</i> (<i>e.g.</i> those of Chartres, Namur, Ghent, Messina, Venice,
etc.), separate volumes were devoted to the Latin MSS. in the
Bibliothèque Royale at Brussels (2 vols., 1886-1889), to the Latin
and Greek MSS. in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris (5 vols.,
1889-1896), to the Greek MSS. in the Vatican (1899), and to the
Latin MSS. in the libraries of Rome (1905 seq.). They also
prepared inventories of the hagiographic texts hitherto published,
and of these there have appeared the <i>Bibliotheca hagiographica
graeca</i> (1895), the <i>Bibliotheca hagiographica latina</i> (1899) and the
<i>Bibliotheca hagiographica Orientalis</i>. These indispensable works
delayed the publication of the principal collection, but tended to
give it a more solid basis and a strictly scientific stamp. In 1887
appeared vol. i. for November; in 1894, vol. ii., preceded by the
<i>Martyrologium Hieronymianum</i> by J.B. de Rossi and the abbé
Louis Duchesne; in 1902, the <i>Propylaeum ad Acta Sanctorum
Novembris</i>, comprising the <i>Synaxarium ecclesiae Constantinopolitanae</i>.</p>

<p>There are three editions of the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i>: the original
edition (Antwerp, Tongerloo and Brussels, 63 vols., 1643-1902);
the Venice edition, stopping at vol. v. of September (1734-1770);
and the Paris edition, stopping at vol. xiii. of October (61 vols.,
1863-1883). In addition to these, there is a volume of tables,
edited by the abbé Rigollot.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLOGNA, GIOVANNI DA<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span> (1524-1608) [Ital. for his real name,
<span class="sc">Jean Bologne</span> or <span class="sc">Boullongne</span>], French sculptor, was born at
Douai in 1524. His early training as a sculptor was conducted at
Antwerp, but at the age of twenty-five he went to Italy and he
settled in 1553 in Florence, where his best works still remain.
His two most celebrated productions are the single bronze
figure of Mercury, poised on one foot, resting on the head of a
zephyr, as if in the act of springing into the air (in the Bargello
gallery), and the marble group known as the Rape of the Sabines,
which was executed for Francesco de&rsquo; Medici and received this
name, Lanzi informs us, after it was finished. It is now in the
Loggia de Lanzi of the ducal piazza. Giovanni was also employed
at Genoa, where he executed various excellent works,
chiefly in bronze. Most of his pieces are characterized by great
spirit and elegance. His great fountain at Bologna (1563-1567)
is remarkable for beauty of proportion. Noteworthy also are his
two fountains in the Boboli gardens, one completed in 1576 and
the other in 1585. He also cast the fine bronze equestrian statue
of Cosimo de&rsquo; Medici at Florence and the very richly decorated
west door of Pisa cathedral. One of Bologna&rsquo;s best works, a group
of two nude figures fighting, is now lost. A fine copy in lead was
at one time in the front quadrangle of Brasenose College, Oxford.
In 1881 it was sold for old lead by the principal and fellows of the
college, and was melted down by the plumber who bought it.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOLOGNA,<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> a city and archiepiscopal see of Emilia, Italy, the
capital of the province of Bologna, and headquarters of the VI.
army corps. It is situated at the edge of the plain of Emilia,
180 ft. above sea-level at the base of the Apennines, 82 m. due N.
of Florence by rail, 63 m. by road and 50 m. direct, and 134 m.
S.E. of Milan by rail. Pop. (1901) town, 102,122; commune,
153,501. The more or less rectangular Roman city, orientated
on the points of the compass, with its streets arranged at right
angles, can be easily distinguished from the outer city, which
received its fortifications in 1206 (see G. Gozzadini, <i>Studi
archeologico-topografici sulla citta di Bologna</i>, Bologna, 1868).
The streets leading to the gates of the latter radiate from the
outskirts, and not from the centre, of the former. Some of the
oldest churches, however, lie outside the limits of the Roman
city (of which no buildings remain above ground) such as
S. Stefano, S. Giovanni in Monte and SS. Vitale ed Agricola.
The first consists of a group of no less than seven different
buildings, of different dates; the earliest of which, the former
cathedral of SS. Pietro e Paolo, was constructed about the middle
of the 4th century, in part with the débris of Roman buildings;
while S. Sepolcro, a circular church with ornamentation in brick
and an imitation of <i>opus reticulatum</i>, should probably be
attributed to the 6th or 7th centuries. The present cathedral
(S. Pietro), erected in 910, is now almost entirely in the baroque
style. The largest church in the town, however, is that of
S. Petronio, the patron saint of Bologna, which was begun in
1390; only the nave and aisles as far as the transepts were,
however, completed, but even this is a fine fragment, in the
Gothic style, measuring 384 ft. long, and 157 wide, whereas the
projected length of the whole (a cruciform basilica) was over
700 ft., with a breadth across the transepts of 460 ft., and a dome
500 ft. high over the crossing (see F. Cavazza in <i>Rassegna d&rsquo; Arte</i>,
1905, 161). The church of S. Domenico, which contains the body
of the saint, who died here in 1221, is unfinished externally,
while the interior was remodelled in the 18th century. There are
many other churches of interest, among them S. Francesco,
perhaps the finest medieval building in Bologna, begun in 1246
and finished in 1260; it has a fine brick campanile of the end
of the 14th century. It was restored to sacred uses in 1887, and
has been carefully liberated from later alterations (U. Berti in
<i>Rassegna d&rsquo; Arte</i>, 1901, 55). The church of Corpus Dominii has
fine 15th-century terra cottas on the façade (F. Malaguzzi Valeri
in <i>Archivio Storico dell&rsquo; Arte</i>, ser. ii. vol. ii. (Rome, 1896), 72).
The centre of the town is formed by the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele
(formerly Piazza Maggiore), and the Piazza del Nettuno, which
lie at right angles to one another. Here are the church of
S. Petronio, the massive Palazzo Comunale, dating from 1245,
the Palazzo del Podesta, completed in the same year, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>179</span>
fine bronze statue of Neptune by Giovanni da Bologna (Jean
Bologne of Douai).</p>

<p>The famous university of Bologna was founded in the 11th
century (its foundation by Theodosius the Great in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 425
is legendary), and acquired a European reputation as a school
of jurisprudence under Pepo, the first known teacher at Bologna
of Roman law (about 1076), and his successor Irnerius and their
followers the glossators. The students numbered between three
and five thousand in the 12th to the 15th century, and in 1262,
it is said, nearly ten thousand (among them were both Dante
and Petrarch). Anatomy was taught here in the 14th century.
But despite its fame, the university, though an autonomous
corporation, does not seem to have had any fixed residence:
the professors lectured in their own houses, or later in rooms
hired or lent by the civic authorities. It was only in 1520 that
the professors of law were given apartments in a building belonging
to the church of S. Petronio; and in 1562, by order of Pius IV.,
the university itself was constructed close by, by Carlo Borromeo,
then cardinal legate. The reason of this measure was no doubt
partly disciplinary, Bologna itself having in 1506 passed under
the dominion of the papacy. Shortly after this, in 1564, Tasso
was a student there, and was tried for writing a satirical poem.
One of the most famous professors was Marcello Malpighi, a
great anatomist of the 17th century. The building has served
as the communal library since 1838. Its courtyard contains the
arms of those students who were elected as representatives of
their respective nations or faculties. The university has since
1803 been established in the (16th century) Palazzo Poggi.
Between 1815 and 1848 the number of students sank to
about a hundred in some years, chiefly owing to the political
persecutions of the government: in 1859 the number had risen
to 355. It now possesses four faculties and is attended by some
1700 students. Among its professors women have more than
once been numbered.</p>

<p>The Museo Civico is one of the most important museums in
Italy, containing especially fine collections of antiquities from
Bologna and its neighbourhood. The picture gallery is equally
important in its way, affording a survey both of the earlier
Bolognese paintings and of the works of the Bolognese eclectics
of the 16th and 17th centuries, the Caracci, Guido Reni, Domenichino,
Guercino, &amp;c. The primitive masters are not of great
excellence, but the works of the masters of the 15th century,
especially those of Francesco Francia (1450-1517) and Lorenzo
Costa of Ferrara (1460-1535), are of considerable merit. The
great treasure of the collection is, however, Raphael&rsquo;s S. Cecilia,
painted for the church of S. Giovanni in Monte, about 1515.</p>

<p>The two leaning towers, the Torre Asinelli and the Torre
Garisenda, dating from 1109 and 1110 respectively, are among
the most remarkable structures in Bologna: they are square
brick towers, the former being 320 ft. in height and 4 ft. out of
the perpendicular, the latter (unfinished) 163 ft. high and 10 ft.
out of the perpendicular. The town contains many fine private
palaces, dating from the 13th century onwards. The streets
are as a rule arcaded, and this characteristic has been preserved
in modern additions, which have on the whole been made with
considerable taste, as have also the numerous restorations of
medieval buildings. A fine view may be had from the Madonna
di S. Luca, on the south-west of the town (938 ft.).</p>

<p>Among the specialities of Bologna may be noted the <i>salami</i>
or <i>mortadella</i> (Bologna sausage), <i>tortellini</i> (a kind of macaroni)
and liqueurs.</p>

<p>Bologna is an important railway centre, just as the ancient
Bononia was a meeting-point of important roads. Here the
main line from Milan divides, one portion going on parallel to
the line of the ancient Via Aemilia (which it has followed from
Piacenza downwards) to Rimini, Ancona and Brindisi, and the
other through the Apennines to Florence and thence to Rome.
Another line runs to Ferrara and Padua, another (eventually
to be prolonged to Verona) to S. Felice sul Panaro, and a third
to Budrio and Portomaggiore (a station on the line from Ferrara
to Ravenna). Steam tramways run to Vignola, Pieve di Cento
and Malalbergo.</p>

<p>Bologna was only for a short while subject to the Lombards,
remaining generally under the rule of the exarchate of Ravenna,
until this in 756 was given by Pippin to the papacy. It was
sacked by the Hungarians in 902, but otherwise its history is
little known, and it is uncertain when it acquired its freedom
and its motto <i>Libertas</i>. But the first &ldquo;constitution&rdquo; of the
commune of Bologna dates from about 1123, and at that time
we find it a free and independent city. From the 12th to the
14th century it was very frequently at war, and strongly supported
the Guelph cause against Frederick II. and against the
neighbouring cities of Romagna and Emilia; indeed, in 1249
the Bolognese took Enzio, the emperor&rsquo;s son, prisoner, and kept
him in confinement for the rest of his life. But the struggles
between Guelphs and Ghibellines in Bologna itself soon followed,
and the commune was so weakened that in 1337 Taddeo de&rsquo; Pepoli
made himself master of the town, and in 1350 his son
sold it to Giovanni Visconti of Milan. Ten years later it was
given to the papacy, but soon revolted and recovered its liberty.
In 1401 Giovanni Bentivoglio made himself lord of Bologna,
but was killed in a rebellion of 1402. It then returned to the
Visconti, and after various struggles with the papacy was again
secured in 1438 by the Bentivoglio, who held it till 1506, when
Pope Julius II. drove them out, and brought Bologna once more
under the papacy, under the sway of which it remained (except
in the Napoleonic period between 1796 and 1815 and during the
revolutions of 1821 and 1831) until in 1860 it became part of the
kingdom of Italy.</p>

<p>Among the most illustrious natives of Bologna may be noted
Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), the discoverer of galvanism, and
Prospero Lambertini (Pope Benedict XIV.).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLSENA<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span> (anc. <i>Volsinii</i>),<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> a town of the province of Rome,
Italy, 12 m. W.S.W. of Orvieto by road, situated on the north-east
bank of the lake of Bolsena. Pop. (1901) 3286. The town
is dominated by a picturesque medieval castle, and contains
the church of S. Christina (martyred by drowning in the lake,
according to the legend, in 278) which dates from the 11th
century and contains some frescoes, perhaps of the school of
Giotto. It has a fine Renaissance façade, constructed about
1500 by Cardinal Giovanni de&rsquo; Medici (afterwards Pope Leo X.),
and some good terra cottas by the Della Robbia. Beneath the
church are catacombs, with the tomb of the saint, discovered
in 1880 (E. Stevenson in <i>Notizie degli Scavi</i>, 1880, 262; G.B. de
Rossi in <i>Bullettino d&rsquo;Archeologia Cristiana</i>, 1880, 109). At one
of the altars in this crypt occurred the miracle of Bolsena in 1263.
A Bohemian priest, sceptical of the doctrine of transubstantiation,
was convinced of its truth by the appearance of drops of
blood on the host he was consecrating. In commemoration of
this Pope Urban IV. instituted the festival of Corpus Christi,
and ordered the erection of the cathedral of Orvieto. The
miracle forms the subject of a celebrated fresco by Raphael in
the Vatican.</p>

<p>The Lake of Bolsena (anc. <i>Lacus Volsiniensis</i>), 1000 ft. above
sea-level, 71 sq. m. in area, and 480 ft. deep, is almost circular,
and was the central point of a large volcanic district, though it is
probably not itself an extinct crater. Its sides show fine basaltic
formation in places. It abounds in fish, but its banks are
somewhat deserted and not free from malaria. It contains two
islands, Bisentina and Martana, the former containing a church
constructed by Vignola, the latter remains of the castle where
Amalasuntha, the daughter of Theodoric, was imprisoned and
strangled.</p>

on a sharp slope above a stream tributary to the river

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span>
shortly after the Conquest by William Peveril, but the existing
building, a fine castellated residence, was erected on its site in

remain. The church of St Mary is of Norman and later date; it
contains some interesting early stone-carving, and monuments
to the family of Cavendish, who acquired the castle in the 16th
century. Coal-mining and quarrying are carried on in the

<p><span class="bold">BOLSWARD,<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> a town in the province of Friesland, Holland,
6½ m. W.N.W. of Sneek. A steam-tramway connects it with
Sneek, Makkum, Harlingen and Franeker. Pop. (1900) 6517.
The Great church, or St Martin&rsquo;s (1446-1466) is a large building
containing some good carving, a fine organ and the tombs of
many Frisian nobles. The so-called Small church, dating from
about 1280, also contains fine carving and tombstones; and
is the remnant of a Franciscan convent which once existed
here. Bolsward also possesses a beautiful renaissance town-hall
(1614-1618) and various educational and charitable institutions,
including a music and a drawing school. It has an active trade
in agricultural produce, and some spinning-mills and tile and
pottery works. The town is mentioned in 725, when it was
situated on the Middle Sea. When this receded, a canal was cut
to the Zuider Zee, and in 1422 it was made a Hansa town.</p>

<p>The medieval constitution of Bolsward, though in its government
by eight <i>scabini</i>, with judicial, and four councillors with
administrative functions, it followed the ordinary type of Dutch
cities, was in some ways peculiar. The family of Jongema had
certain hereditary rights in the administration, which, though
not mentioned in the town charter of 1455, were defined in that
of 1464. According to this the head of the family sat for two
years with the <i>scabini</i> and the third year with the councillors,
and had the right to administer an oath to one of each body.
More singular was the influential position assigned, in civic
legislation and administration, to the clergy, to whom in conjunction
with the councillors, there was even, in certain cases,
an appeal from the judgment of the <i>scabini</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLT,<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> an O. Eng. word (compare Ger. <i>Bolz</i>, an arrow), for a
&ldquo;quarrel&rdquo; or cross-bow shaft, or the pin which fastened a door.
From the swift flight of an arrow comes the verb &ldquo;to bolt,&rdquo; as
applied to a horse, &amp;c., and such expressions as &ldquo;bolt upright,&rdquo;
meaning straight upright; also the American use of &ldquo;bolt&rdquo; for
refusing to support a candidate nominated by one&rsquo;s own party.
In the sense of a straight pin for a fastening, the word has come
to mean various sorts of appliances. From the sense of &ldquo;fastening
together&rdquo; is derived the use of the word &ldquo;bolt&rdquo; as a definite
length (in a roll) of a fabric (40 ft. of canvas, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>From another &ldquo;bolt&rdquo; or &ldquo;boult,&rdquo; to sift (through O. Fr.

<p><span class="bold">BOLTON, DUKES OF.<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> The title of duke of Bolton was held in
the family of Powlett or Paulet from 1689 to 1794. Charles
Powlett, the 1st duke (<i>c.</i> 1625-1699), who became 6th marquess
of Winchester on his father&rsquo;s death in 1675, had been member
of parliament for Winchester and then for Hampshire from 1660
to 1675. Having supported the claim of William and Mary to
the English throne in 1688, he was restored to the privy council
and to the office of lord-lieutenant of Hampshire, and was
created duke of Bolton in April 1689. An eccentric man, hostile
to Halifax and afterwards to Marlborough, he is said to have
travelled during 1687 with four coaches and 100 horsemen,
sleeping during the day and giving entertainments at night.
He died in February 1699, and was succeeded by his elder son,
Charles, 2nd duke of Bolton (1661-1722), who had also been a
member of parliament for Hampshire and a supporter of William
of Orange. He was lord-lieutenant of Hampshire and of Dorset,
a commissioner to arrange the union of England and Scotland;
and was twice a lord justice of the kingdom. He was also lord
chamberlain of the royal household; governor of the Isle of
Wight; and for two short periods was lord-lieutenant of Ireland.
His third wife was Henrietta (d. 1730), a natural daughter of
James, duke of Monmouth. According to Swift this duke was
&ldquo;a great booby.&rdquo; His eldest son, Charles, 3rd duke of Bolton
(1685-1754), was a member of parliament from 1705 to 1717,
when he was made a peer as Baron Pawlet of Basing. He filled
many of the public offices which had been held by his father,
and also attained high rank in the British army. Having
displeased Sir Robert Walpole he was deprived of several of his
offices in 1733; but some of them were afterwards restored to
him, and he raised a regiment for service against the Jacobites
in 1745. He was a famous gallant, and married for his second
wife the singer, Lavinia Fenton (d. 1760), a lady who had
previously been his mistress. He died in August 1754, and was
succeeded as 4th duke by his brother Harry (<i>c.</i> 1690-1759),
who had been a member of parliament for forty years, and who
followed the late duke as lord-lieutenant of Hampshire. The
4th duke&rsquo;s son, Charles (<i>c.</i> 1718-1765), who became 5th duke
in October 1759, committed suicide in London in July 1765,
and was succeeded by his brother Harry (<i>c.</i> 1719-1794), an
admiral in the navy, on whose death without sons, in December
1794, the dukedom became extinct. The other family titles
descended to a kinsman, George Paulet (1722-1800), who thus
became 12th marquess of Winchester. In 1778 Thomas Orde
(1746-1807) married Jean Mary (d. 1814), a natural daughter
of the 5th duke of Bolton, and this lady inherited Bolton Castle
and other properties on the death of the 6th duke. Having
taken the additional name of Powlett, Orde was created Baron
Bolton in 1797, and the barony has descended to his heirs.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLTON<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Boulton</span>), <span class="bold">EDMUND</span> (1575?-1633?), English
historian and poet, was born by his own account in 1575. He
was brought up a Roman Catholic, and was educated at Trinity
Hall, Cambridge, afterwards residing in London at the Inner
Temple. In 1600 he contributed to <i>England&rsquo;s Helicon</i>. He was a
retainer of the duke of Buckingham, and through his influence he
secured a small place at the court of James I. Bolton formulated
a scheme for the establishment of an English academy, but the
project fell through after the death of the king, who had regarded
it favourably. He wrote a <i>Life of King Henry II.</i> for Speed&rsquo;s
<i>Chronicle</i>, but his Catholic sympathies betrayed themselves in
his treatment of Thomas Becket, and a life by Dr John Barcham
was substituted (Wood, <i>Ath. Oxon.</i> ed. Bliss, iii. 36). The most
important of his numerous works are <i>Hypercritica</i> (1618?), a
short critical treatise valuable for its notices of contemporary
authors, reprinted in Joseph Haslewood&rsquo;s <i>Ancient Critical Essays</i>
(vol. ii., 1815); <i>Nero Caesar, or Monarchic Depraved</i> (1624),
with special note of British affairs. Bolton was still living in
1633, but the date of his death is unknown.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLTON<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Bolton-le-Moors</span>), a municipal, county and parliamentary
borough of Lancashire, England, 196 m. N.W. by N.
from London and 11 m. N.W. from Manchester. Pop. (1891)
146,487; (1901) 168,215. Area, 15,279 acres. It has stations
on the London &amp; North-Western and the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire
railways, with running powers for the Midland railway. It is
divided by the Croal, a small tributary of the Irwell, into Great
and Little Bolton, and as the full name implies, is surrounded
by high moorland. Although of early origin, its appearance,
like that of other great manufacturing towns of the vicinity,
is wholly modern. It owes not a little to the attractions of its
site. The only remnants of antiquity are two houses of the 16th
century in Little Bolton, of which one is a specially good example
of Tudor work. The site of the church of St Peter has long been
occupied by a parish church (there was one in the 12th century,
if not earlier), but the existing building dates only from 1870.
There may also be mentioned a large number of other places of
worship, a town hall with fine classical façade and tower, market
hall, museums of natural history and of art and industry, an
exchange, assembly rooms, and various benevolent institutions.
Several free libraries are maintained. Lever&rsquo;s grammar school,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span>
founded in 1641, had Robert Ainsworth, the Latin lexicographer,
and John Lemprière, author of the classical dictionary, among
its masters. There are municipal technical schools. A large
public park, opened in 1866, was laid out as a relief work for
unemployed operatives during the cotton famine of the earlier
part of the decade. On the moors to the north-west, and including
Rivington Pike (1192 ft.), is another public park, and there
are various smaller pleasure grounds. A large number of cotton
mills furnish the chief source of industry; printing, dyeing and
bleaching of cotton and calico, spinning and weaving machine
making, iron and steel works, and collieries in the neighbourhood,
are also important. The speciality, however, is fine spinning, a
process assisted by the damp climate. The parliamentary
borough, created in 1832 and returning two members, falls within
the Westhoughton division of the county. Before 1838, when
Bolton was incorporated, the town was governed by a borough-reeve
and two constables appointed at the annual court-leet.
The county borough was created in 1888. The corporation
consists of a mayor, 24 aldermen and 72 councillors.</p>

<p>The earliest form of the name is Bodleton or Botheltun, and
the most important of the later forms are Bodeltown, Botheltun-le-Moors,
Bowelton, Boltune, Bolton-super-Moras, Bolton-in-ye-Moors,
Bolton-le-Moors. The manor was granted by William I.
to Roger de Poictou, and passed through the families of Ferrers
and Pilkington to the Harringtons of Hornby Castle, who lost
it with their other estates for their adherence to Richard III.
In 1485 Henry VII. granted it to the first earl of Derby. The
manor is now held by different lords, but the earls of Derby still
have a fourth part. The manor of Little Bolton seems to have
been, at least from Henry III.&rsquo;s reign, distinct from that of Great
Bolton, and was held till the 17th century by the Botheltons or
Boltons.</p>

<p>From early days Bolton was famous for its woollen manufactures.
In Richard I.&rsquo;s reign an aulneger, whose duty it was
to measure and stamp all bundles of woollen goods, was
appointed, and it is clear, therefore, that the place was already
a centre of the woollen cloth trade. In 1337 the industry received
an impulse from the settlement of a party of Flemish clothiers,
and extended so greatly that when it was found necessary in 1566
to appoint by act of parliament deputies to assist the aulnegers,
Bolton is named as one of the places where these deputies were
to be employed. Leland in his <i>Itinerary</i> (1558) recorded the
fact that Bolton made cottons, which were in reality woollen
goods. Real cotton goods were not made in Lancashire till 1641,
when Bolton is named as the chief seat of the manufacture of
fustians, vermilions and dimities. After the revocation of the
edict of Nantes the settlement of some French refugees further
stimulated this industry. It was here that velvets were first
made about 1756, by Jeremiah Clarke, and muslins and cotton
quiltings in 1763. The cotton trade received an astonishing
impetus from the inventions of Sir Richard Arkwright (1770),
and Samuel Crompton (1780), both of whom were born in the
parish. Soon after the introduction of machinery, spinning
factories were erected, and the first built in Bolton is said to have
been set up in 1780. The number rapidly increased, and in 1851
there were 66 cotton mills with 860,000 throstle spindles at
work. The cognate industry of bleaching has been carried on
since early in the 18th century, and large ironworks grew up in
the latter half of the 19th century. In 1791 a canal was constructed
from Manchester to Bolton, and by an act of parliament
(1792) Bolton Moor was enclosed.</p>

<p>During the Civil War Bolton sided with the parliament, and
in February 1643 and March 1644 the royalist forces assaulted
the town, but were on both occasions repulsed. On the 28th of
May 1644, however, it was attacked by Prince Rupert and Lord
Derby, and stormed with great slaughter. On the 15th of
October 1651 Lord Derby, who had been taken prisoner after the
battle of Worcester, was brought here and executed the same
day.</p>

<p>Up to the beginning of the 19th century the market day was
Monday, but the customary Saturday market gradually superseded
this old chartered market. In 1251 William de Ferrers
obtained from the crown a charter for a weekly market and a
yearly fair, but gradually this annual fair was replaced by four
others chiefly for horses and cattle. The New Year and Whitsuntide
Show fairs only arose during the 19th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLTON ABBEY,<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> a village in the West Riding of Yorkshire,
England, 22 m. N.W. from Leeds and 5½ from Ilkley by the
Midland railway. It takes its name, inaccurately, from the great
foundation of Bolton Priory, the ruins of which are among the
most exquisitely situated in England. They stand near the right
bank of the upper Wharfe, the valley of which is beautifully
wooded and closely enclosed by hills. The earliest part of the
church is of transitional Norman date; the nave, which is
perfect, is Early English and Decorated. The transepts and
choir are ruined, and the remains of domestic buildings are
slight. The manor of Bolton Abbey with the rest of the district
of Craven was granted by William the Conqueror to Robert de
Romili, who evidently held it in 1086, although there is no
mention made of it in the Domesday survey. William de
Meschines and Cicely de Romili, his wife, heiress of Robert,
founded and endowed a priory at Embsay or Emmesay, near
Skipton, in 1120, but it was moved here in 1151 by their daughter,
Alice de Romili, wife of William FitzDuncan, who gave the
manor to the monks in exchange for other lands. After the
dissolution of the monasteries the manor was sold in 1542 to
Henry Clifford, 2nd earl of Cumberland, whose descendants,
the dukes of Devonshire, now hold it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOLZANO, BERNHARD<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> (1781-1848), Austrian priest and
philosopher, was born at Prague on the 5th of October 1781.
He distinguished himself at an early age, and on his ordination
to the priesthood (1805) was appointed professor of the
philosophy of religion in Prague University. His lectures, in
which he endeavoured to show that Catholic theology is in
complete harmony with reason, were received with eager interest
by the younger generation of thinkers. But his views met with
much opposition; and it was only through the protection of
the archbishop, Prince Salm-Salm, that he was enabled to
retain his chair. In 1820 he was accused of being connected with
some of the students&rsquo; revolutionary societies, and was compelled
to resign. Several doctrines extracted from his works were
condemned at Rome, and he was suspended from his priestly
functions, spending the rest of his life in literary work. He died
at Prague on the 18th of December 1848. The most important
of his numerous works are the <i>Wissenschaftslehre, oder Versuch
einer neuen Darstellung der Logik</i>, advocating a scientific method
in the study of logic (4 vols., Sulzbach, 1837); the <i>Lehrbuch der
Religionswissenschaft</i> (4 vols., Sulzbach, 1834), a philosophic
representation of all the dogmas of Roman Catholic theology;
and <i>Athanasia, oder Gründe für die Unsterblichkeit der Seele</i>
(2nd ed., Mainz, 1838). In philosophy he followed Reinhard
in ethics and the monadology of Leibnitz, though he was also
influenced by Kant.</p>

river Congo about 60 m. from its mouth, the administrative
capital of Belgian Congo. Pop. about 5000. It was one of the
places at which the European traders on the west coast of Africa
established stations in the 16th and 17th centuries. It became
the entrepôt for the commerce of the lower Congo and a well-known
mart for slaves. The trade was chiefly in the hands of
Dutch merchants, but British, French and Portuguese firms
also had factories there. No European power exercised sovereignty,
though shadowy claims were from time to time put
forward by Portugal (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Africa</a></span>, § 5). In 1884 the natives
of Boma granted a protectorate of their country to the International
Association of the Congo.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOMB,<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> a term formerly used for an explosive shell (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ammunition</a></span>)
fired by artillery. The word is derived from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>
Gr. <span class="grk" title="bombos">&#946;&#972;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#962;</span>, a hammering, buzzing noise, cf. &ldquo;bombard&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>).
At the present day it is most frequently used of a shattering or
incendiary grenade, or of an explosive vessel actuated by clockwork
or trip mechanism, employed to destroy life or property.
In naval warfare, before the introduction of the shell gun, explosive
projectiles were carried principally by special vessels
known as bomb-vessels, bombards or, colloquially, bombs.</p>

<p>In geology, the name &ldquo;bomb&rdquo; is given to certain masses of
lava which have been hurled forth from a volcanic vent by
explosive action. In shape they are spheroidal, ellipsoidal or
discoidal; in structure they may be solid, hollow or more or
less cavernous; whilst in size they vary from that of a walnut
to masses weighing several tons. It is generally held that the
form is partly due to rotation of the mass during its aerial flight,
and in some cases the bomb becomes twisted by a gyratory
movement. According, however, to Dr H.J. Johnston-Lavis,
many of the so-called bombs of Vesuvius are not projectiles, but
merely globular masses formed in a stream of lava; and in like
manner Professor J.D. Dana showed that what were regarded as
bombs in Hawaii are in many cases merely lava-balls that have
not been hurled through the air. Certain masses of pumice
ejected from Vulcano have been called by Johnston-Lavis
&ldquo;bread-crust bombs,&rdquo; since they present a coating of obsidian
which has been bent and cracked in a way suggestive of the
crust of a roll. It is probable that here the acid <span class="correction" title="amended from magna">magma</span> was
expelled in a very viscous condition, and the crust which formed
on cooling was burst by the steam from the occluded water.
Some of the bombs thrown out during recent eruptions of Etna
consist of white granular quartz, encased in a black scoriaceous
crust, the quartz representing an altered sandstone. The
bombs of granular olivine, found in some of the tuffs in
the Eifel, are represented in most geological collections (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Volcano</a></span>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOMBARD<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> (derived through Med. Lat. and Fr. forms from
Gr. <span class="grk" title="bombein">&#946;&#959;&#956;&#946;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>, to make a humming noise), a term applied in
the middle ages to a sort of cannon, used chiefly in sieges, and
throwing heavy stone balls; hence the later use as a verb (see
BOMBARDMENT). The name, in various forms, was also given
to a medieval musical instrument (&ldquo;bombard,&rdquo; &ldquo;bumhart,&rdquo;
&ldquo;pumhart,&rdquo; &ldquo;pommer&rdquo;), the forerunner of the bass oboe
or schalmey. At the present day a small primitive oboe called
<i>bombarde</i>, with eight holes but no keys, is used among the Breton
peasants.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOMBARDIER,<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> originally an artilleryman in charge of a
bombard; now a non-commissioned officer in the artillery of
the British army, ranking below a corporal.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOMBARDMENT,<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> an attack by artillery fire directed against
fortifications, troops in position or towns and buildings. In its
strict sense the term is only applied to the bombardment of
defenceless or undefended objects, houses, public buildings, &amp;c.,
the object of the assailant being to dishearten his opponent, and
specially to force the civil population and authorities of a
besieged place to persuade the military commandant to capitulate
before the actual defences of the place have been reduced to
impotence. It is, therefore, obvious that mere bombardment
can only achieve its object when the amount of suffering inflicted
upon non-combatants is sufficient to break down their resolution,
and when the commandant permits himself to be influenced
or coerced by the sufferers. A threat of bombardment will
sometimes induce a place to surrender, but instances of its
fulfilment being followed by success are rare; and, in general,
with a determined commandant, bombardments fail of their
object. Further, an intentionally terrific fire at a large target,
unlike the slow, steady and minutely accurate &ldquo;artillery
attacks &ldquo;directed upon the fortifications, requires the expenditure
of large quantities of ammunition, and wears out the guns
of the attack. Bombardments are, however, frequently resorted
to in order to test the temper of the garrison and the civil population,
a notable instance being that of Strassburg in 1870.
The term is often loosely employed to describe artillery attacks
upon forts or fortified positions in preparation for assaults by
infantry.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOMBARDON,<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Bass Tuba</span>, the name given to the bass and
contrabass of the brass wind in military bands, called in the
orchestra bass tuba.</p>

<p>The name of bombardon is unquestionably derived from <i>bombardone</i>,
the Italian for contrabass pommer (bombard), which,
before the invention of the fagotto, formed the bass of medieval
orchestras; it is also used for a bass reed stop of 16 ft. tone on the
organ. The bombardon was the very first bass wind instrument
fitted with valves, and it was at first known as the <i>corno basso</i>,
<i>clavicor</i> or <i>bass horn</i> (not to be confounded with the bass horn
with keys, which on being perfected became the ophicleide).
The name was attached more to the position of the wind instruments
as bass than to the individual instrument. The original
corno basso was a brass instrument of narrow bore with the
pistons set horizontally. The valve-ophicleide in F of German
make had a wider bore and three vertical pistons, but it was
only a &ldquo;half instrument,&rdquo; measuring about 12 ft. A. Kalkbrenner,
in his life of W. Wieprecht (1882), states that in the
Jäger military bands of Prussia the corno basso (keyed bass
horn) was introduced as bass in 1829, and the bombardon (or
valve-ophicleide) in 1831; in the Guards these instruments were
superseded in 1835 by the bass tuba invented by Wieprecht and
J.G. Moritz.</p>

<p>The modern bombardon is made in two forms: the upright
model, used in stationary band music; and the circular model,
known as the helicon, worn round the body with the large bell
resting on the left shoulder, after the style of the Roman <i>cornu</i>
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Horn</a></span>), which is a more convenient way of carrying this
heavy instrument when marching. The bombardon, and the
euphonium, of which it is the bass, are the outcome of the
application of valves to the bugle family whereby the saxhorns
were also produced. The radical difference between the saxhorns
and the tubas (including the bombardon) is that the latter have
a sufficiently wide conical bore to allow of the production of
fundamental sounds in a rich, full quality of immense power.
This difference, first recognized in Germany and Austria, has
given rise in those countries to the classification of the brass
wind as &ldquo;half&rdquo; and &ldquo;whole&rdquo; instruments (<i>Halbe</i> and <i>Ganze
Instrumente</i>). When the brass wind instruments with conical
bore and cup-shaped mouthpiece first came into use, it was a
well-understood principle that the tube of each instrument must
theoretically be made twice as long as an organ pipe giving the
same note; for example, the French horn sounding the 8 ft. C
of an 8 ft. organ pipe, must have a tube 16 ft. long; C then
becomes the second harmonic of the series for the 16 ft. tube,
the first or fundamental being unobtainable. After the introduction
of pistons, instrument-makers experimenting with the
bugle, which has a conical bore of very wide diameter in proportion
to the length, found that baritone and bass instruments
constructed on the same principle gave out the fundamental
full and clear. A new era in the construction of brass wind
instruments was thus inaugurated, and now that the proportions
of the bugle have been adopted, the tubes of the tubas are made
just half the length of those of the older instruments, corresponding
to the length of the organ pipe of the same pitch, so that a
euphonium sounding 8 ft. C no longer needs to be 16 ft. long
but only 8 ft. The older instruments, such as the saxhorns,
with narrow bore, have therefore been denominated &ldquo;half
instruments,&rdquo; because only half the length of the instrument is
of practical utility, while the tubas with wide bore are styled
&ldquo;whole instruments.&rdquo; <a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Bombardons are made in E flat and
F of the 16 ft. octave, corresponding to the orchestral bass tuba,
double bass in strings, and pedal clarinet and contrafagotto
in the wood wind. The bombardon in B flat or C, an octave
lower than the euphonium, corresponds to the contrabass tuba
in the orchestra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The bombardons possess a chromatic compass of 3½ to 4 octaves.

<div class="center"><img style="width:520px; height:94px" src="images/img183b.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The lowest notes produced by the valves are very difficult to
obtain, for the lips seldom have sufficient power to set in vibration
a column of air of such immense length, at a rate of vibration slow
enough to synchronize with that of notes of such deep pitch.<a name="fa2f" id="fa2f" href="#ft2f"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Even
when they are played, the lowest valve notes can hardly be heard
unless doubled an octave higher by another bombardon.</p>

<p>Bombardons are generally treated as non-transposing instruments,
the music being written as sounded, except in France and Belgium,
where transposition is usual. The intervening notes are obtained
by means of pistons or valves, which, on being depressed, either
admit the wind into additional lengths of tubing to lower the pitch,
or cut off a length in order to raise it. Bombardons usually have
three or four pistons lowering the pitch of the instrument respectively
1, ½, 1½ and 2½ tones (in Belgium, 1, ½, 2 and 3 tones). The valve
system, disposal of the tubing and shape and position of the bell
differ considerably in the various models of well-known makers.
In Germany and Austria<a name="fa3f" id="fa3f" href="#ft3f"><span class="sp">3</span></a> what is known as the cylinder action is
largely used; for the piston or pump is substituted a four-way
brass cock operated by means of a key and a series of cranks.</p>

<p>In order to obtain a complete chromatic scale throughout the
compass, there must be, as on the slide-trombone, seven different
positions or lengths of tubing available, each having its harmonic
series. These different lengths are obtained on the bombardon by
means of a combination of pistons: the simultaneous use of Nos. 2
and 3 lowers the pitch two tones; of Nos. 1, 2 and 3, three tones;
of Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, five and a half tones, &amp;c. A combination of
pistons, however, fails to give the interval with an absolutely correct
intonation, since the length of tubing thrown open is not of the
theoretical length required to produce it. Many ingenious contrivances
have been invented from time to time to remedy this
inherent defect of the valve system, such as the six-valve independent
system of Adolphe Sax; the Besson <i>Registre</i>, giving eight independent
positions; the Besson compensating system <i>Transpositeur</i>;
the Boosey automatic compensating piston invented by D.J.
Blaikley, and V. Mahillon&rsquo;s automatic regulating pistons. More
recently the Besson enharmonic valve system, with six independent
tuning slides and three pistons, and Rudall, Carte &amp; Company&rsquo;s new
(Klussmann&rsquo;s patent) bore, conical throughout the open tube and
additional lengths, have produced instruments which leave nothing
to be desired as to intonation. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Valves</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tuba</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOMBAY CITY,<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> the capital of Bombay Presidency, and
the chief seaport of western India, situated in 18° 55&prime; N. and
72° 54&prime; E. The city stands on an island of the same name,
which forms one of a group now connected by causeways with
the mainland. The area is 22 sq. m.; and the population of the
town and island (1901) 776,006 (estimate in 1906, 977,822).
Bombay is the second most populous city in the Indian empire,
having fallen behind Calcutta at the census of 1901. Its position
on the side of India nearest to Europe, its advantages as a
port and a railway centre, and its monopoly of the cotton
industry, are counteracted by the fact that the region which it
serves cannot vie with the valley of the Ganges in point of
fertility and has no great waterway like the Ganges or Brahmaputra.
Nevertheless Bombay pushes Calcutta hard for supremacy
in point of population and commercial prosperity.</p>

<p>The Bombay Island, or, as it ought to be more correctly
called, the Bombay Peninsula, stands out from a coast ennobled
by lofty hills, and its harbour is studded by rocky islands and
precipices, whose peaks rise to a great height. The approach
from the sea discloses one of the finest panoramas in the world,&mdash;the
only European analogy being the Bay of Naples. The
island consists of a plain about 11 m. long by 3 broad, flanked
by two parallel lines of low hills. A neck of land stretching
towards the south-west forms the harbour on its eastern side,
sheltering it from the force of the open sea, and enclosing an
expanse of water from 5 to 7 m. wide. At the south-west of
the island, Back Bay, a shallow basin rather more than 2 m.
in breadth, runs inland for about 3 m. between the extreme
points of the two ranges of hills. On a slightly raised strip of
land between the head of Back Bay and the harbour is situated
the fort, the nucleus of the city of Bombay. From this point
the land slopes westward towards the central plain, a low-lying
tract, which before the construction of the embankment known
as the Hornby Vellard, used at high tide to be submerged by the
sea. The town itself consists of well-built and unusually handsome
native bazaars, and of spacious streets devoted to European
commerce. In the native bazaar the houses rise three or four
storeys in height, with elaborately carved pillars and front work.
Some of the European hotels and commercial buildings are on
the American scale, and have no rival in any other city of India.
The Taj Mahal hotel, which was built by the Tata family in
1904, is the most palatial and modern hotel in India. The
private houses of the European residents lie apart alike from
the native and from the mercantile quarters of the town. As a
rule, each is built in a large garden or compound; and although
the style of architecture is less imposing than that of the stately
residences in Calcutta, it is well suited to the climate, and has a
beauty and comfort of its own. The favourite suburb is Malabar
hill, a high ridge running out into the sea, and terraced to the
top by handsome houses, which command one of the finest
views, of its kind, in the world. Of recent years wealthy natives
have been competing with Europeans for the possession of this
desirable quarter. To the right of this ridge, looking towards
the sea, runs another suburb known as Breach Candy, built
close upon the beach and within the refreshing sound of the
waves. To the left of Malabar hill lies Back Bay, with a promontory
on its farther shore, which marks the site of the old
Bombay Fort; its walls are demolished, and the area is chiefly
devoted to mercantile buildings. Farther round the island,
beyond the fort, is Mazagon Bay, commanding the harbour,
and the centre of maritime activity. The defences of the port,
remodelled and armed with the latest guns, consist of batteries
on the islands in the harbour, in addition to which there are
three large batteries on the mainland. There is also a torpedo-boat
detachment stationed in the harbour.</p>

<p>No city in the world has a finer water-front than Bombay.
The great line of public offices along the esplanade and facing
Back Bay, which are in the Gothic style mixed with Saracenic,
are not individually distinguished for architectural merit, but
they have a cumulative effect of great dignity. The other
most notable buildings in the city are the Victoria terminus of
the Great Indian Peninsula railway and the Taj Mahal hotel.
Towards the northern end of Malabar hill lie the Parsee Towers
of Silence, where the Parsees expose their dead till the flesh is
devoured by vultures, and then cast the bones into a well where
they crumble into dust. The foundation-stone of a museum
was laid by the prince of Wales in 1905.</p>

<p><i>Local Government</i>.&mdash;The port of Bombay (including docks
and warehouses) is managed by a port trust, the members of
which are nominated by the government from among the commercial
community. The municipal government of the city
was framed by an act of the Bombay legislative council passed
in 1888. The governing body consists of a municipal corporation
and a town council. The corporation is composed of 72 members,
of whom 16 are nominated by the government. Of the remainder,
36 are elected by the ratepayers, 16 by the justices of the peace,
2 by the senate of the university, and 2 by the chamber of
commerce. The council, which forms the standing committee
of the corporation, consists of 12 members, of whom 4 are
nominated by the government and the rest elected by the corporation.
The members of the corporation include Europeans,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>184</span>
Hindus, Mahommedans and Parsees. The Bombay University
was constituted in 1857 as an examining body, on the model of
the university of London. The chief educational institutions
in Bombay City are the government Elphinstone College, two
missionary colleges (Wilson and St Xavier), the Grant medical
college, the government law school, the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy
school of art, and the Victoria Jubilee technical institute.</p>

<p><i>Docks</i>.&mdash;The dockyard, originally built in 1736, has a sea-face
of nearly 700 yds. and an area of about 200 acres. There are
five graving docks, three of which together make one large dock
648 ft. long, while the other two make a single dock 582 ft. long.
There are also four building slips opposite the Apollo Bandar
(landing-place) on the south-east side of the enclosure. The dockyard
is lighted by electricity, so that work can be carried on by
night as well as day. Bombay is the only important place near
the sea in India where the rise of the tide is sufficient to permit
docks on the largest scale. The highest spring tides here reach
17 ft., but the average is 14 ft. Prince&rsquo;s dock, of which the
foundation-stone was laid by the prince of Wales in 1875, was
opened in 1879, and is 1460 ft. long by 1000 ft. broad, with a
water area of 30 acres; while the Victoria dock, which was
completed and opened in 1887-1888, has a water area of 25 acres.
South of the Victoria dock, the foundation-stone of the Alexandra
dock, the largest in India, was laid by the prince of Wales in 1905.</p>

<p><i>Cotton Mills</i>.&mdash;The milling industry is, next to the docks,
the chief feature of Bombay&rsquo;s commercial success. The staple
manufacture is cotton-spinning, but in addition to this there are
flour mills and workshops to supply local needs. The number
of factories increased from fifty-three in 1881 to eighty-three in
1890, and that decade saw the influx of a great industrial population
from the surrounding districts; but the decade 1891-1901
witnessed at least a temporary set-back owing to the ravages
caused by plague and the effects of over-production. In addition
to the actual mortality it inflicted, the plague caused an exodus
of the population from the island, disorganized the labour at the
docks and in the mills, and swallowed up large sums which were
spent by the municipality on plague operations and sanitary
improvements. After 1901, however, both population and trade
began to revive again. In 1901 there were 131,796 persons
employed in the cotton industry.</p>

<p><i>Population</i>.&mdash;Owing to its central position between East and
West and to the diversity of races in India, no city in the world
can show a greater variety of type than Bombay. The Mahratta
race is the dominant element next to the European rulers, but
in addition to them are a great and influential section of Parsee
merchants, Arab traders from the Gulf, Afghans and Sikhs
from northern India, Bengalis, Rajputs, Chinese, Japanese,
Malays, negroes, Tibetans, Sinhalese and Siamese. Bombay
is the great port and meeting-place of the Eastern world. Out of
the large sections of its population, Hindu, Mahommedan, Parsee,
Jain and Christian, the Parsees are one of the smallest and yet
the most influential. They number only some 46,000 all told,
but most of the great business houses are owned by Parsee
millionaires and most of the large charities are founded by them.</p>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;The name of the island and city of Bombay is derived
from Mumba (a form of Parvati), the goddess of the Kolis,
a race of husbandmen and fishermen who were the earliest
known inhabitants, having occupied the island probably about
the beginning of the Christian era. Bombay originally consisted
of seven islands (the <i>Heptanesia</i> of Ptolemy) and formed an
outlying portion of the dominions of successive dynasties dominant
in western India: Satavahanas, Mauryas, Chalukyas and
Rashtrakutas. In the Maurya and Chalukya period (450-750)
the city of Puri on Elephanta Island was the principal place in
Bombay harbour. The first town built on Bombay Island was
Mahikavati (Mahim), founded by King Bhima, probably a member
of the house of the Yadavas of Deogiri, as a result of Ala-ud-din
Khilji&rsquo;s raid into the Deccan in 1294. It remained under Hindu
rule until 1348, when it was captured by a Mahommedan force
from Gujarat; and the islands remained part of the province
(later kingdom) of Gujarat till 1534, when they were ceded by
Sultan Bahadur to the Portuguese.</p>

<p>The island did not prosper under Portuguese rule. By the
system known as <i>aforamento</i> the lands were gradually parcelled
out into a number of fiefs granted, under the crown of Portugal,
to individuals or to religious corporations in return for military
service or equivalent quit-rents. The northern districts were
divided among the Franciscans and Jesuits, who built a number
of churches, some of which still survive. The intolerance of their
rule did not favour the growth of the settlement, which in 1661,
when it was transferred to the British, had a population of only
10,000. The English had, however, long recognized its value
as a naval base, and it was for this reason that they fought the
battle of Swally (1614-1615), attempted to capture the place in
1626, and that the Surat Council urged the purchase of Bombay
from the Portuguese. In 1654 the directors of the Company drew
Cromwell&rsquo;s attention to this suggestion, laying stress on the
excellence of its harbour and its safety from attack by land.
It finally became the property of the British in 1661 as part of
the dowry of the infanta Catherine of Portugal on her marriage
to Charles II., but was not actually occupied by the British until
1665, when they experienced much difficulty in overcoming
the opposition of the Portuguese, and especially of the religious
orders, to the cession. In 1668 it was transferred by the crown
to the East India Company, who placed it under the factory of Surat.</p>

<p>The real foundation of the modern city dates from this time,
and was the work of Gerald Aungier (or Angier), brother of
Francis Aungier, 3rd Lord Aungier of Longford and 1st earl of
Longford in Ireland (d. 1700), who succeeded Sir George Oxenden
as president of Surat in 1669 and died in 1677. At this time Bombay
was threatened by the Mahrattas from inland, by the Malabar
pirates and the Dutch from the sea, and was cut off from the
mainland by the Portuguese, who still occupied the island of
Salsette and had established a customs-barrier in the channel
between Bombay and the shore. In spite of the niggardly
policy of the court of directors, who refused to incur the expense
of employing skilled engineers, Aungier succeeded in fortifying
the town and shore; he also raised a force of militia and regulars,
the latter mainly Germans (as more trustworthy than the riffraff
collected in London by the Company&rsquo;s crimps). In 1672
Aungier transferred his headquarters to Bombay, and after
frightening off an imposing Dutch fleet, which in 1670 attempted
to surprise the island, set to work to organize the settlement
anew. To this task he brought a mind singularly enlightened and
a sincere belief in the best traditions of English liberty. In
its fiscal policy, in its religious intolerance, and in its cruel
and contemptuous treatment of the natives, Portuguese rule had
been alike oppressive. Aungier altered all this. With the consent
of &ldquo;a general assembly of the chief representatives of the
people&rdquo; he commuted the burdensome land tax for a fixed
money payment; he protected all castes in the celebration of
their religious ceremonies; and he forbade any compulsion of
natives to carry burdens against their will. The result was that
the population of Bombay increased rapidly; a special quarter
was set apart for the banya, or capitalist, class of Hindus; while
Parsees and Armenians flocked to a city where they were secure
of freedom alike for their trade and their religion. Within
eight years the population had grown from 10,000 to 60,000.
The immediate result of this concentration of people in a spot
so unwholesome was the prevalence of disease, produced by
the appalling sanitary conditions. This, too, Aungier set himself
to remedy. In 1675 he initiated the works for draining the foul
tidal swamps; and, failing the consent of the Company to the
erection of a regular hospital, he turned the law court into an
infirmary. He also set up three courts of justice: a tribunal
for petty causes under a factor with native assessors, a court of
appeal under the deputy governor and members of council, and
a court-martial. A regular police force was also established and
a gaol built in the Bazaar.<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>During this period, however, the position of Bombay was
sufficiently precarious. The Malabar pirates, though the city
itself was too strong for them, were a constant menace to its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>185</span>
trade; and it required all the genius of Aungier to maintain the
settlement, isolated as it was between the rival powers of the
Mahrattas and the Mogul empire. After his death, on the 30th
of June 1677, its situation became even more precarious. Even
under Aungier the Siddi admirals of the Moguls had asserted
their right to use Bombay harbour as winter quarters for their
fleet, though they had failed to secure it as a base against the
Mahrattas. Under his weak successor (Rolt, 1677-1682), the
English waters, the value of which had now been proved, became
the battle-ground between the rival navies, and for some years
Bombay lay at the mercy of both. The Company&rsquo;s rule, moreover,
was exposed to another danger. The niggardly policy of the
board of directors, more intent on peaceful dividends than on
warlike rule, could not but be galling to soldiers of fortune.
A mutiny at Bombay in 1674 had only been suppressed by the
execution of the ringleader; and in 1683 a more formidable
movement took place under Richard Keigwin, a naval officer
who had been appointed governor of St Helena in reward for the
part played by him in the capture of the island from the Dutch
in 1673. Keigwin, elected governor of Bombay by popular vote,
issued a proclamation in the king&rsquo;s name, citing the &ldquo;intolerable
extortions, oppressions and exactions&rdquo; of the Company, and
declaring his government under the immediate authority of the
crown. He ruled with moderation, reformed the system of
taxation, obtained notable concessions from the Mahrattas, and
increased the trade of the port by the admission of &ldquo;interlopers.&rdquo;
But he failed to extend the rebellion beyond Bombay; and when
a letter arrived, under the royal sign manual, ordering him to
surrender the fort to Sir John Child, appointed admiral and
captain-general of the Company&rsquo;s forces, he obeyed.<a name="fa2g" id="fa2g" href="#ft2g"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Company had decided to consider Bombay as
&ldquo;an independent settlement, and the seat of the power and trade
of the English in the East Indies.&rdquo; But a variety of causes set
back the development of the city, notably the prevalence of
plague and cholera due to the silting up of the creeks that
divided its component islands; and it was not till after the
amalgamation of the old and new companies in 1708 that the
governor&rsquo;s seat was transferred from Surat to Bombay. In 1718
the city wall was completed; settlers began to stream in, especially
from distracted Gujarat; and a series of wise administrative
reforms increased this tendency until in 1744 the population,
which in 1718 had sunk to 16,000, had risen to 70,000. Meanwhile
the Mahratta conquest of Bassein and Salsette (1737-1739)
had put a stop to the hostility of the Portuguese, and a
treaty of alliance with the Siddis (1733) had secured a base of
supplies on the mainland. The French wars of 1744-1748 and
1756-1763 led to a further strengthening of the fortifications;
and the influx of settlers from the mainland made the questions
of supplies and of the protection of trade from piracy more
pressing. The former was in part settled by the acquisition of
Bankot (1755) as a result of an alliance with the peshwa, the
latter by the successful expedition under Watson and Clive
against Vijayadrug (1756). During this period, too, the
importance of Bombay as a naval base, long since recognized, was
increased by the building of a dock (1750), a second being added
in 1762. The year 1770 saw the beginning of the cotton trade
with China, the result of a famine in that country, the Chinese
government having issued an edict commanding more land to be
used for growing grain. This, too, was a period of searching
reforms in the administration and the planning and building of
the city; the result being a further immense growth of its
population, which in 1780 was 113,000. This was still further
increased by the famine of 1803, which drove large numbers of
people from Konkan and the Deccan to seek employment in
Bombay. A great fire broke out in the fort in the same year and
caused enormous loss; but it enabled the government to open
wider thoroughfares in the more congested parts, and greatly
stimulated the tendency of the natives to build their houses and
shops outside the walls of the fort in what are now some of the
busiest parts of the city.</p>

<p>The British victory over the Mahrattas and the annexation
of the Deccan opened a new period of unrestricted development
for Bombay. At this time, too (1819), its fortunes were vigorously
fostered by Mountstuart Elphinstone, and in 1838 the population
had risen to 236,000. But in the next fifty years it more than
doubled itself, the figures for 1891 being 821,000. This great
leap was due to the influence of railways, of which the first line
was completed in 1853, the opening of the Suez Canal, and the
foundation of cotton factories. In 1866-1867 the tide of prosperity
was interrupted by a financial crisis, due to the fall in
the price of cotton on the termination of the American war.
Bombay, however, soon recovered herself, and in 1891 was more
prosperous than ever before; but during the ensuing decade
great havoc was played by plague (<i>q.v.</i>) with both her population
and her trade. In addition to a decline of 6% in the population,
the exports also declined by 7%, whereas Calcutta&rsquo;s exports
rose during the same period by 38%.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOMBAY FURNITURE.<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> &ldquo;Bombay blackwood furniture&rdquo; is a term
applied to a rather extensive class of articles manufactured
in the city of Bombay and in the towns of Surat and
Ahmedabad in India. The wood used is Shisham or blackwood
(<i>Dalbergia</i>), a hard-grained dark-coloured timber which with
proper treatment assumes a beautiful natural polish. Much of
the so-called Bombay furniture is clumsy and inelegant in form,
defects which it is suggested by experts, like Sir George Birdwood,
it owes to the circumstance that the original models were Dutch.
Some of the smaller articles, such as flower stands, small tables,
and ornamental stands, are, however, of exceedingly graceful
contour, and good examples are highly prized by collectors. The
carving at its best is lace-like in character, and apart from its
inherent beauty is attractive on account of the ingenuity shown
by the worker in adapting his design in detail to the purpose of
the article he is fashioning. The workmen who manufacture the
most artistic Bombay furniture are a special class with inherited
traditions. Often a man knows only one design, which has been
transmitted to him by his father, who in his turn had had it
from his father before him. In recent years under European
auspices efforts have been made with a certain measure of success
to modernize the industry by introducing portions of the native
work into furniture of Western design. In the main, however,
the conventional patterns are still adhered to. &ldquo;Bombay boxes&rdquo;
are inlaid in geometrical patterns on wood. The inlaying
materials consist of the wire, sandal wood, sapan wood,
ebony, ivory and stags&rsquo; horns, and the effect produced by the
combination of minute pieces of these various substances is
altogether peculiar and distinctive.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOMBAY PRESIDENCY,<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> a province or presidency of British India,
consisting partly of British districts, and partly of native
states under the administration of a governor. This territory
extends from 13° 53&prime; to 28° 45&prime; N., and from 66° 40&prime; to 76° 30&prime; E.,
and is bounded on the N. by Baluchistan, the Punjab and
Rajputana; on the E. by Indore, the Central Provinces and
Hyderabad; on the S. by Madras and Mysore; and on the W.
by the Arabian Sea. Within these limits lie the Portuguese
settlements of Diu, Damaun and Goa, and the native state of
Baroda which has direct relations with the government of India;
while politically Bombay includes the settlement of Aden.
The total area, including Sind but excluding Aden, is 188,745
sq. m., of which 122,984 sq. m. are under British and 65,761
under native rule. The total population (1901) is 25,468,209, of
which 18,515,587 are resident in British territory and 6,908,648
in native states. The province is divided into four
commissionerships and twenty-six districts. The four divisions
are the northern or Gujarat, the central or Deccan, the southern
or Carnatic, and Sind. The twenty-six districts are: Bombay
City, Ahmedabad, Broach, Kaira, Panch Mahals, Surat, Thana,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>186</span>
Ahmednagar, Khandesh (partitioned into two districts in 1906),
Nasik, Poona, Satara, Sholapur, Belgaum, Bijapur, Dharwar,
Kanara, Kolaba, Ratnagiri, Karachi, Hyderabad, Shikarpur,
Thar and Parkar, and Upper Sind Frontier. The native states
comprise in all 353 separate units, which are administered
either by political agents or by the collectors of the districts in
which the smaller states are situated. The chief groups of states
are North Gujarat, comprising Cutch, Kathiawar agency,
Palanpur agency, Mahi Kantha agency, Rewa Kantha agency
and Cambay; South Gujarat, comprising Dharampur, Bansda
and Sachin; North Konkan, Nasik and Khandesh, comprising
Khandesh political agency, Surgana and Jawhar; South Konkan
and Dharwar, comprising Janjira, Sawantwari and Savanur;
the Deccan Satara Jagirs, comprising Akalkot, Bhor, Aundh,
Phaltan, Jath and Daphlapur; the southern Mahratta states,
comprising Kolhapur and other states, and Khairpur in Sind.
The native states under the supervision of the government of
Bombay are divided, historically and geographically, into two
main groups. The northern or Gujarat group includes the
territories of the gaekwar of Baroda, with the smaller states
which form the administrative divisions of Cutch, Palanpur,
Rewa Kantha, and Mahi Kantha. These territories, with the
exception of Cutch, have an historical connexion, as being the
allies or tributaries of the gaekwar in 1805, when final engagements
were included between that prince and the British
government. The southern or Mahratta group includes Kolhapur,
Akalkot, Sawantwari, and the Satara and southern Mahratta
Jagirs, and has an historical bond of union in the friendship
they showed to the British in their final struggle with the power
of the peshwa in 1818. The remaining territories may conveniently
be divided into a small cluster of independent zamin-daris,
situated in the wild and hilly tracts at the northern
extremity of the Sahyadri range, and certain principalities
which, from their history or geographical position, are to some
extent isolated from the rest of the presidency.</p>

<p><i>Physical Aspects</i>.&mdash;The Bombay Presidency consists of a long
strip of land along the Indian Ocean from the south of the Punjab
to the north of Mysore. The coast is rock-bound and difficult
of access; and though it contains several bays forming fairweather
ports for vessels engaged in the coasting trade, Bombay,
Karachi-in-Sind, Marmagoa and Karwar alone have harbours
sufficiently land-locked to protect shipping during the prevalence
of the south-west monsoon. The coast-line is regular and little
broken, save by the Gulfs of Cambay and Cutch, between which
lies the peninsula of Kathiawar.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, a range of hills, known as the Western
Ghats, runs down the coast, at places rising in splendid bluffs
and precipices from the water&rsquo;s edge, at others retreating
inland, and leaving a flat fertile strip of 5 to 50 m.
<span class="sidenote">Mountains.</span>
between their base and the sea. In the north of the
presidency on the right bank of the Indus, the Hala mountains,
a continuation of the great Suleiman range, separate British
India from the dominions of the khan of Kalat. Leaving
Sind, and passing by the ridges of low sandhills,&mdash;the leading
feature of the desert east of the Indus,&mdash;and the isolated hills
of Cutch and Kathiawar, which form geologically the western
extremity of the Aravalli range, the first extensive mountain
range is that separating Gujarat from the states of central India.
The rugged and mountainous country south of the Tapti forms
the northern extremity of the Sahyadri or Western Ghats. This
great range of hills, sometimes overhanging the ocean, and
generally running parallel to it at a distance nowhere exceeding
50 m., with an average elevation of about 1800 ft., contains
individual peaks rising to more than double that height. They
stretch southwards for upwards of 500 m., with a breadth of
10 to 20 m. The western declivity is abrupt, the land at the base
of the hills being but slightly raised above the level of the sea. As
is usually the case with the trap formation, they descend to the
plains in terraces with abrupt fronts. The landward slope is in
many places very gentle, the crest of the range being sometimes
but slightly raised above the level of the plateau of the Deccan.
Their best-known elevation is Mahabaleshwar, 4500 ft. high, a
fine plateau, 37 m. from Poona, covered with rich vegetation, and
used by the Bombay government as its summer retreat and
sanitarium. In the neighbourhood of the Sahyadri hills, particularly
towards the northern extremity of the range, the
country is rugged and broken, containing isolated peaks, masses
of rock and spurs, which, running eastward, form watersheds for
the great rivers of the Deccan. The Satpura hills separate the
valley of the Tapti from the valley of the Nerbudda, and the
district of Khandesh from the territories of Indore. The
Satmala or Ajanta hills, which are rather the northern slope of
the plateau than a distinct range of hills, separate Khandesh
from the Nizam&rsquo;s Dominions.</p>

<p>The more level parts of Bombay consist of five well-demarcated
tracts&mdash;Sind, Gujarat, the Konkan, the Deccan, and the Carnatic.
Sind, or the lower valley of the Indus, is very flat, with
but scanty vegetation, and depending for productiveness
<span class="sidenote">Plains.</span>
entirely on irrigation. Gujarat, except on its northern
parts, consists of rich, highly cultivated alluvial plains, watered
by the Tapti and Nerbudda, but not much subject to inundation.
The Konkan lies between the Western Ghats and the sea. It is
a rugged and difficult country, intersected by creeks, and abounding
in isolated peaks and detached ranges of hills. The plains
of the Deccan and Khandesh are watered by large rivers, but as
the rainfall is uncertain, they are generally, during the greater
part of the year, bleak and devoid of vegetation. The Carnatic
plain, or the country south of the river Kistna, consists of
extensive tracts of black or cotton soil in a high state of
cultivation.</p>

<p>The chief river of western India is the Indus, which enters
the presidency from the north of Sind and flowing south in a
tortuous course, falls into the Arabian Sea by several
mouths, such as the Ghizri creek, Khudi creek, Pitiani
<span class="sidenote">Rivers.</span>
creek, Sisa creek, Hajamro creek, Vatho creek, Mall creek, Wari
creek, Bhitiara creek, Sir creek and Khori creek. In the dry
season the bed varies at different places from 480 to 1600 yds.
The flood season begins in March and continues till September,
the average depth of the river rising from 9 to 24 ft., and the
velocity of the current increasing from 3 to 7 m. an hour. Next
to the Indus comes the Nerbudda. Rising in the Central Provinces,
and traversing the dominions of Holkar, the Nerbudda
enters the presidency at the north-western extremity of the
Khandesh district, flows eastward, and after a course of 700 m.
from its source, falls into the Gulf of Cambay, forming near its
mouth the alluvial plain of Broach, one of the richest districts
of Bombay. For about 100 m. from the sea the Nerbudda is at
all seasons navigable by small boats, and during the rains by
vessels of from 30 to 50 tons burden. The Tapti enters the
presidency a few miles south of the town of Burhanpur, a station
on the Great Indian Peninsula railway, flows eastward through
the district of Khandesh, the native state of Rewa Kantha and
the district of Surat, and falls into the Gulf of Cambay, a few
miles west of the town of Surat. The Tapti drains about 250 m.
of country, and is, in a commercial point of view, the most useful
of the Gujarat rivers. Besides these there are many minor
streams. The Banas and the Saraswati take their rise in the
Aravalli hills, and flowing eastward through the native state of
Palanpur, fall into the Runn of Cutch. The Sabarmati and the
Mahi rise in the Mahi Kantha hills, and flowing southwards,
drain the districts of Northern Gujarat, and fall into the sea near
the head of the Gulf of Cambay. The streams which, rising in
the Sahyadri range, or Western Ghats, flow westward into the
Arabian Sea, are of little importance. During the rains they are
formidable torrents, but with the return of the fair weather they
dwindle away, and during the hot season, with a few exceptions,
they almost dry up. Clear and rapid as they descend the hills,
on reaching the lowlands of the Konkan they become muddy
and brackish creeks. The Kanarese rivers have a larger body of
water and a more regular flow than the streams of the Konkan.
One of them, the Sharawati, forcing its way through the western
ridge of the Ghats, plunges from the high to the low country by
a succession of falls, the principal of which is 800 ft. in height.
The Sahyadri, or Western Ghats, also throw off to the eastward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span>
the two principal rivers of the Madras Presidency, the Godavari
and the Kistna. These rivers collect countless tributary streams,
some of them of considerable size, and drain the entire plain
of the Deccan as they pass eastward towards the Bay of
Bengal.</p>

<p>The Manchar Lake is situated on the right bank of the Indus.
During inundations it attains a length of 20 m., and a breadth
of 10, covering a total area estimated at 180 sq. m.
But the most peculiar lacustrine feature of the presidency
<span class="sidenote">Lakes.</span>
is the Runn or Lake of Cutch, which, according to the
season of the year, is a salt marsh, an inland lake, or an arm of
the sea with an area of 8000 sq. m. It forms the western boundary
of the province of Gujarat, and when flooded during the rains
unites the Gulfs of Cutch and Cambay, and converts the territory
of Cutch into an island.</p>

<p><i>Geology</i>.&mdash;South of Gujarat nearly the whole of Bombay is
covered by the horizontal lava flows of the Deccan Trap series,
and these flows spread over the greater part of the Kathiawar
peninsula and extend into Cutch. In Cutch and Kathiawar
they are underlaid by Jurassic and Neocomian beds. The
Jurassic beds are marine and contain numerous Ammonites,
but the beds which are referred to the Neocomian include a
series of sandstones and shales with remains of plants. Several
of the plants are identical with forms which occur in the upper
portion of the Gondwana system. Tertiary limestones, sandstones
and shales overlie the Deccan Trap in Cutch, but the
greatest development of deposits of this age is to be met with
on the western side of the Indus (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sind</a></span>). The plain of Sind
and of eastern Gujarat is covered by alluvium and wind-blown
sand.</p>

<p><i>Climate</i>.&mdash;Great varieties of climate are met with in the
presidency. In its extreme dryness and heat, combined with the
aridity of a sandy soil, Upper Sind resembles the sultry deserts
of Africa. The mean maximum temperature at Hyderabad, in
Lower Sind, during the six hottest months of the year, is 98° F.
in the shade, and the water of the Indus reaches blood heat;
in Upper Sind it is even hotter, and the thermometer has been
known to register 130° in the shade. In Cutch and in Gujarat
the heat, though less, is still very great. The Konkan is hot and
moist, the fall of rain during the monsoon sometimes approaching
300 in. The table-land of the Deccan above the Ghats, on the
contrary, has an agreeable climate except in the hot months,
as has also the southern Mahratta country; and in the hills of
Mahabaleshwar, Singarh, and other detached heights, Europeans
may go out at all hours with impunity. Bombay Island itself,
though in general cooled by the sea breeze, is oppressively hot
during May and October. The south-west monsoon generally
sets in about the first week in June, and pours down volumes
of rain along the coast. From June to October travelling is
difficult and unpleasant, except in Sind, where the monsoon
rains exert little influence.</p>

<p><i>Forests</i>.&mdash;Bombay Presidency possesses two great classes
of forests&mdash;those of the hills and those of the alluvial plains.
The hill forests are scattered over a wide area, extending from
23° to 14° N. lat. Most of them lie among the Sahyadri hills or
Western Ghats. The alluvial forests lie in Sind, on or close to
the banks of the Indus, and extend over an area of 550 sq. m.
The principal timber trees in the forests are&mdash;teak; blackwood
of two varieties (<i>Dalbergia Sisu</i> and <i>Dalbergia latifolia</i>), <i>Dalbergia
ujainensis, Pterocarpus Marsupium, Terminalia glabra, Acacia
arabica, Acacia Catechu, Nauclea cordifolia, Nauclea parvifolia,
Bidelia spinosa, Hardwickia binata, Juga xylocarpa, Populus
euphratica</i>, and <i>Tamarindus indica</i>. The forests contain many
trees which, on account of their fruits, nuts or berries, are
valuable, irrespective of the quality of their timber. Among
these are the mango (<i>Mangifera indica</i>); the jack (<i>Artocarpus
integrifolia</i>), <i>Zizypkus Jujuba, Aegle Marmelos, Terminalia
Chebula, Calophyllum Inophyllum, Bassia latifolia</i> and <i>Pongamia
glabra</i>. The jungle tribes collect gum from several varieties of
trees, and in Sind the Forest Department derives a small revenue
from lac. The palms of the presidency consist of cocoa-nut,
date, palmyra and areca catechu.</p>

<p><i>Population</i>.&mdash;The census of 1901 gave a total of 25,468,209,
out of which the chief religions furnished the following
numbers:&mdash;</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="width: 40%;" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">Hindu</td> <td class="tcr">19,916,438</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Mahommedan</td> <td class="tcr">4,567,295</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Jain</td> <td class="tcr">535,950</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Zoroastrian</td> <td class="tcr">78,552</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Christian</td> <td class="tcr">216,118</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In Sind Islam has been the predominant religion from the
earliest Arab conquest in the 8th century. In Gujarat the
predominant religion is Hinduism, though petty Mahommedan
kingdoms have left their influence in many parts of the province.
The Deccan is the home of the Mahrattas, who constitute 30%
of the population. The Konkan is notable for various Christian
castes, owing their origin to Portuguese rule; while in the
Carnatic, Lingayatism, a Hindu reformation movement of the
12th century, has been embraced by 45% of the population.
The Mahrattas are the dominating race next to the Europeans and
number (1901) 3,650,000, composed of 1,900,000 Kunbis, 350,000
Konkanis, and 1,400,000 Mahrattas not otherwise specified.</p>

<p><i>Languages</i>.&mdash;The chief languages of the presidency are Sindhi
in Sind, Cutchi in Cutch, Gujarati and Hindustani in Gujarat,
Mahratti in Thana and the central division, Gujarati and
Mahratti in Khandesh, and Mahratti and Kanarese in the
southern division. There are also Bhil (120,000) and Gipsy
(30,000) dialects.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture</i>.&mdash;The staple crops are as follows:&mdash;Joar (<i>Sorghum
vulgare</i>) and bajra (<i>Holcus spicatus</i>) are the staple food grains
in the Deccan and Khandesh. Rice is the chief product of the
Konkan. Wheat, generally grown in the northern part of the
Presidency, but specially in Sind and Gujarat, is exported to
Europe in large quantities from Karachi, and on a smaller scale
from Bombay. Barley is principally grown in the northern
parts of the presidency. Nachani (<i>Eleusine coracana</i>) and kodra
(<i>Paspalum serobiculatum</i>), inferior grains grown on the hill-sides,
furnish food to the Kolis, Bhils, Waralis, and other aboriginal
tribes. Of the pulses the most important are gram (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>), tur
(<i>Cajanus indicus</i>), kulti (<i>Dolichos biflorus</i>), and mug
(<i>Phaseolus Mungo</i>). Principal oil-seeds: til (<i>Sesamum orientale</i>),
mustard, castor-oil, safflower and linseed. Of fibres the
most important are cotton, Deccan hemp (<i>Hibiscus cannabinus</i>),
and sunn or tag (<i>Crotalaria juncea</i>). Much has been done to
improve the cotton of the presidency. American varieties have
been introduced with much advantage in the Dharwar collectorate
and other parts of the southern Mahratta country.
In Khandesh the indigenous plant from which one of the lowest
classes of cotton in the Bombay market takes its name has been
almost entirely superseded by the superior Hinganghat variety.
Miscellaneous crops: sugar-cane, requiring a rich soil and a
perennial water-supply, and only grown in favoured localities,
red pepper, potatoes, turmeric and tobacco.</p>

<p><i>Manufactures</i>.&mdash;The chief feature of the modern industrial
life of Bombay is the great development in the growth and
manufacture of cotton. Large steam mills have rapidly sprung
up in Bombay City, Ahmedabad and Khandesh. In 1905 there
were 432 factories in the presidency, of which by far the greater
number were engaged in the preparation and manufacture of
cotton. The industry is centred in Bombay City and Island,
which contains nearly two-thirds of the mills. During the decade
1891-1901 the mill industry passed through a period of depression
due to widespread plague and famine, but on the whole there has
been a marked expansion of the trade as well as a great improvement
in the class of goods produced. In addition to the
mills there are (1901) 178,000 hand-loom weavers in the province,
who still have a position of their own in the manipulation of
designs woven into the cloth. Silk goods are manufactured in
Ahmedabad, Surat, Yeola, Nasik, Thana and Bombay, the
material being often decorated with printed or woven designs;
but owing to the competition of European goods most branches
of the industry are declining. The custom of investing savings
in gold and silver ornaments gives employment to many
goldsmiths; the metal is usually supplied by the customer, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span>
the goldsmith charges for his labour. Ahmedabad and Surat
are famous for their carved wood-work. Many of the houses in
Ahmedabad are covered with elaborate wood-carving, and excellent
examples exist in Broach, Baroda, Surat, Nasik and
Yeola. Salt is made in large quantities in the government works
at Kharaghoda and Udu in Ahmedabad, whence it is exported
by rail to Gujarat and central India. There is one brewery at
Dapuri near Poona.</p>

<p><i>Railways and Irrigation</i>.&mdash;The province is well supplied with
railways, all of which, with one exception, concentrate at
Bombay City. The exception is the North-Western line, which
enters Sind from the Punjab and finds its natural terminus at
Karachi. The other chief lines are the Great Indian Peninsula,
Indian Midland, Bombay, Baroda &amp; Central India, Rajputana-Malwa
&amp; Southern Mahratta systems. In 1905 the total
length of railway under the Bombay government open for traffic
was 7980 m. These figures do not include the railway system
in Sind. With the exception of Sind, the water-supply of the
Bombay Presidency does not lend itself to the construction of
large irrigation works.</p>

<p><i>Army.</i>&mdash;Under Lord Kitchener&rsquo;s re-arrangement of the
Indian army in 1904 the old Bombay command was abolished
and its place was taken by the Western army corps under a
lieutenant-general. The army corps was divided into three
divisions under major-generals. The 4th division, with headquarters
at Quetta, comprises the troops in the Quetta and
Sind districts. The 5th division, with headquarters at Mhow,
consists of three brigades, located at Nasirabad, Jubbulpore and
Jhansi, and includes the previous Mhow, Deesa, Nagpur, Nerbudda
and Bundelkhand districts, with the Bombay district
north of the Tapti. The 6th division, with headquarters at
Poona, consists of three brigades, located at Bombay, Ahmednagar
and Aden. It comprises the previous Poona district,
Bombay district south of the Tapti, Belgaum district north
of the Tungabhadra, and Dharwar and Aurungabad districts.</p>

<p><i>Education</i>.&mdash;The university of Bombay, established in 1857,
is a body corporate, consisting of a chancellor, vice-chancellor
and fellows. The governor of Bombay is <i>ex officio</i> chancellor.
The education department is under a director of public instruction,
who is responsible for the administration of the department
in accordance with the general educational policy of the state.
The native states have generally adopted the government
system. Baroda and the Kathiawar states employ their own
inspectors. In 1905 the total number of educational institutions
was 10,194 with 593,431 pupils. There are ten art colleges,
of which two are managed by government, three by native
states, and five are under private management. According to
the census of 1901, out of a population of 25½ millions nearly
24 millions were illiterate.</p>

<p><i>Administration</i>.&mdash;The government of Bombay is administered
by a governor in council consisting of the governor as president
and two ordinary members. The governor is appointed from
England; the council is appointed by the crown, and selected
from the Indian civil service. These are the executive members
of government. For making laws there is a legislative council,
consisting of the governor and his executive council, with certain
other persons, not fewer than eight or more than twenty, at
least half of them being non-officials. Each of the members of
the executive council has in his charge one or two departments
of the government; and each department has a secretary,
an under-secretary, and an assistant secretary, with a
numerous staff of clerks. The political administration of the
native states is under the superintendence of British agents
placed at the principal native courts; their position varies in
different states according to the relations in which the principalities
stand with the paramount power. The administration
of justice throughout the presidency is conducted by a high
court at Bombay, consisting of a chief justice and seven puisne
judges, along with district and assistant judges throughout the
districts of the presidency. The administration of the districts
is carried on by collectors, assistant collectors, and a varying
number of supernumerary assistants.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;In the earliest times of which any record remains
the greater part of the west coast of India was occupied by
Dravidian tribes, living under their kings in fortified villages,
carrying on the simpler arts of life, and holding a faith in which
the propitiation of spirits and demons played the chief part.
There is evidence, however, that so early as 1000 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> an export
trade existed to the Red Sea by way of East Africa, and before
750 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> a similar trade had sprung up with Babylon by way of
the Persian Gulf. It was by this latter route that the traders
brought back to India the Brahmi alphabet, the art of brick-making
and the legend of the Flood. Later still the settlement
of Brahmans along the west coast had already Aryanized the
country in religion, and to some extent in language, before the
Persian conquest of the Indus valley at the close of the 6th
century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The Persian dominion did not long survive; and
the march of Alexander the Great down the Indus paved the
way for Chandragupta and the Maurya empire. Under this
empire Ujjain was the seat of a viceroy, a prince of the imperial
house, who ruled over Kathiawar, Malwa and Gujarat. On the
death of Asoka in 231 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the empire of the Mauryas broke up,
and their heritage in the west fell to the Andhra dynasty of
the Satavahanas of Paithan on the Godavari, a Dravidian family
whose dominion by 200 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> stretched across the peninsula from
the deltas of the Godavari and Kistna to Nasik and the Western
Ghats. About <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 210, however, their power in the west seems
to have died out, and their place was taken by the foreign dynasty
of the Kshaharatas, the Saka satraps of Surashtra (Kathiawar),
who in 120 had mastered Ujjain and Gujarat and had built up
a rival kingdom to the north. Since about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 40 the coast
cities had been much enriched by trade with the Roman empire,
which both the Satavahanas and the satraps did much to
encourage; but after the fall of Palmyra (273) and the extinction
of the main Kshaharata dynasty (<i>c</i>. 300) this commerce fell
into decay. The history of the century and a half that follows
is very obscure; short-lived Saka dynasties succeeded one another
until, about 388, the country was conquered by the Guptas of
Magadha, who kept a precarious tenure of it till about 470,
when their empire was destroyed by the White Huns, or Ephthalites
(<i>q.v</i>.), who, after breaking the power of Persia and assailing
the Kushan kingdom of Kabul, poured into India, conquered
Sind, and established their dominion as far south as the Nerbudda.</p>

<p>Under the Hun tyranny, which lasted till the overthrow of
the White Huns on the Oxus by the Turks (<i>c</i>. 565), native
dynasties had survived, or new ones had established themselves.
In Kathiawar a chief named Bhatarka, probably of foreign
origin, had established himself at Valabhi (Wala) on the ruins
of the Gupta power (<i>c</i>. 500), and founded a dynasty which
lasted until it was overthrown by Arab invaders from Sind in
770.<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The northern Konkan was held by the Mauryas of Puri
near Bombay, the southerly coast by the Kadambas of Vanavasi,
while in the southern Deccan Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas
struggled for the mastery. A new power, too, appeared from
the north: the Gurjaras (ancestors, it is supposed, of the Gujar
caste), who had probably entered India with the White Huns,
established their power over Gujarat and (<i>c</i>. 600) overran north-eastern
Kathiawar, made the raja of Valabhi their tributary, and
established a branch at Broach (585-740). During the short-lived
empire of Harsha (d. 647 or 648), Malwa, Gujarat and
Kathiawar were subject to his sway; but the southern boundary
of his kingdom was the Nerbudda, south of which the Chalukyas
in the 7th century, having overcome the Rashtrakutas and other
rivals, had absorbed the smaller kingdoms into their empire.
In 710-711 (92 <span class="scs">A.H.</span>) the Arabs invaded India, and in 712 conquered
and established themselves in Sind; they did not,
however, attempt any serious attack on the Gurjara and Chalukya
empires, confining themselves to more or less serious raids. In
770 they destroyed the city of Valabhi and, as already mentioned,
brought its dynasty to an end. Meanwhile the Chalukyas,
after successfully struggling with the Pallavas (whose capital
was taken by Vikramaditya II., <i>c</i>. 740), had in their turn succumbed
to their ancient rivals the Rashtrakutas, who succeeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>189</span>
to the bulk of their dominions, including Gujarat, where they had
set up a branch line. For some two centuries (<i>c.</i> 750-950)
there was a balance of power between the Gurjaras and Rashtrakutas,
neither kingdom being strong enough to encroach on
the other to any extent. The Rashtrakutas were, moreover,
debarred from large schemes of conquest by dissensions with
the branch dynasty which they had set up in Gujarat and by
the constant threat of attack by the Chalukyas from Mysore.
Nevertheless their power and magnificence (they were notable
builders and patrons of literature) greatly impressed the Arabs,
by whom the king was known as Balhara (<i>i.e. Vallhaba</i>, &ldquo;well-beloved&rdquo;),
a title borrowed from the preceding dynasty. Under
them the Konkan and the coast farther south were governed
by chiefs of the Silahara family, whose rule is mainly notable for
the revival of trade with the Persian Gulf and, doubtless as a
result of this, the arrival in 775 on the west coast of a number of
Parsee refugees, who found, in a country where three religions
were already equally honoured, the toleration denied to them in
Mussulman Persia. But in the 10th century the Rashtrakuta
power began to break up; in 961 Mularaja Solanki (Chalukya)
conquered the kingdom of Anhilvada (Anhilvara) in Gujarat,
where his dynasty reigned till 1242; and twelve years later the
Chalukyas once more overthrew the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan,
establishing their capital at Kalyani, while a branch line was set
up in southern Gujarat. Farther south the Silaharas, however,
continued to rule the coast, and succeeded in maintaining their
independence until after the final fall of the Chalukyas in 1192.
The cause of the downfall of the dynasty, splendid and enlightened
as any of its predecessors, was the system of governing by means
of great feudatories, which also proved fatal to the Solanki
rajas of Anhilvada. From 1143 onward the power of the latter
had been overshadowed by that of the Vaghela chiefs of Dholka,
and during the same period the Deccan had been rapidly
lapsing into absolute anarchy, amid which rival chiefs struggled
for the supreme power. In the end the Yadavas of Devagiri
(Daulatabad) prevailed, and in 1192 established a short-lived
empire to which the Dholka princes were ultimately forced to
become tributary.</p>

<p>But meanwhile a new power had appeared, which was destined
to establish the Mussulman domination in western and southern
India. In 1023 Mahmud of Ghazni had already invaded Gujarat
with a large army, destroyed the national Hindu idol of Somnath,
and carried away an immense booty. Mahommed Ghori also
invaded Gujarat, and left a garrison in its capital. But it was
not till after the Mussulman power was firmly established in
northern India that the Mahommedan sovereigns of Delhi
attempted the conquest of the south. In 1294 the emperor
Ala-ud-din first invaded the Deccan, and in 1297 he conquered
Gujarat. In 1312 the Mahommedan arms were triumphant
through the Mahratta country; and seven years later the whole
of Malabar fell a prey to the invaders. In the middle of the 14th
century the weakness of the Delhi sovereigns tempted the
governors of provinces to revolt against their distant master,
and to form independent kingdoms. In this way the Bahmani
kingdom was established in the Deccan, and embraced a part
of the Bombay presidency. Ahmednagar and Gujarat also
became the seats of a new kingdom. In 1573 Akbar conquered
Gujarat and reannexed it to the empire; in 1599 he effected the
reconquest of Khandesh, and in 1600 that of Ahmednagar.
From this time the country was never tranquil, and Ahmednagar
became the focus of constant rebellions. During the latter part
of the 17th century the Mahrattas rose into power, and almost
every part of the country now comprising the presidency of
Bombay fell under their sway. In 1498 the Portuguese came
first to Calicut, their earliest possession in the presidency being
the island of Anjidiv. After their victory at Diu over the Egyptian
fleet their mastery of the Indian Ocean was undisputed,
and they proceeded to establish themselves on the coast. They
captured Goa in 1510, Malacca in 1511, and Ormuz in 1515.
They next took advantage of the decay of the kingdom of Gujarat
to occupy Chaul (1531), Bassein with its dependencies, including
Bombay (1534), Diu (1535) and Daman (1559). But the inherent
vices of their intolerant system undermined their power, even
before their Dutch and English rivals appeared on the scene.</p>

<p>The first English settlement in the Bombay presidency was in
1618, when the East India Company established a factory at Surat,
protected by a charter obtained from the emperor Jahangir.
In 1626 the Dutch and English made an unsuccessful attempt
to gain possession of the island of Bombay, and in 1653 proposals
were suggested for its purchase from the Portuguese. In 1661
it was ceded to the English crown, as part of the dower of the
infanta Catherine of Portugal on her marriage with Charles II.
So lightly was the acquisition esteemed in England, and so
unsuccessful was the administration of the crown officers, that
in 1668 Bombay was transferred to the East India Company
for an annual payment of £10. At the time of the transfer,
powers for its defence and for the administration of justice were
also conferred; a European regiment Vas enrolled; and the
fortifications erected proved sufficient to deter the Dutch from
their intended attack in 1673 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bombay City</a></span>: History).
In 1687 Bombay was placed at the head of all the Company&rsquo;s
possessions in India; but in 1753 the government of Bombay
became subordinate to that of Calcutta. The first collision of
the English with the Mahratta power was in 1774 and resulted
in 1782 in the treaty of Salbai, by which Salsette was ceded to
the British, while Broach was handed over to Sindhia. More
important were the results of the second Mahratta war, which
ended in 1803. Surat had already been annexed in 1800; the
East India Company now received the districts of Broach,
Kaira, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In 1803 the Bombay presidency included only Salsette, the
islands of the harbour (since 1774), Surat and Bankot (since
1756); but between this date and 1827 the framework of the
presidency took its present shape. The Gujarat districts were
taken over by the Bombay government in 1805 and enlarged
in 1818; and the first measures for the settlement of Kathiawar
and Mahi Kantha were taken between 1807 and 1820. Baji
Rao, the last of the peshwas, who had attempted to shake off
the British yoke, was defeated, captured and pensioned (1817-1818),
and large portions of his dominions (Poona, Ahmednagar,
Nasik, Sholapur, Belgaum, Kaladgi, Dharwar, &amp;c.) were included
in the presidency, the settlement of which was completed by
Mountstuart Elphinstone, governor from 1819 to 1827. His
policy was to rule as far as possible on native lines, avoiding
all changes for which the population was not yet ripe; but the
grosser abuses of the old régime were stopped, the country was
pacified, the laws were codified, and courts and schools were
established. The period that followed is notable mainly for the
enlargement of the presidency through the lapse of certain
native states, by the addition of Aden (1839) and Sind (1843),
and the lease of the Panch Mahals from Sindhia (1853). The
establishment of an orderly administration, one outcome of
which was a general fall of prices that made the unwonted
regularity of the collection of taxes doubly unwelcome, naturally
excited a certain amount of misgiving and resentment; but
on the whole the population was prosperous and contented,
and under Lord Elphinstone (1853-1860) the presidency passed
through the crisis of the Mutiny without any general rising.
Outbreaks among the troops at Karachi, Ahmedabad and
Kolhapur were quickly put down, two regiments being disbanded,
and the rebellions in Gujarat, among the Bhils, and in the
southern Mahratta country were local and isolated. Under
Sir Bartle Frere (1862-1867) agricultural prosperity reached its
highest point, as a result of the American Civil War and the
consequent enormous demand for Indian cotton in Europe.
The money thus poured into the country produced an epidemic
of speculation known as the &ldquo;Share Mania&rdquo; (1864-1865),
which ended in a commercial crisis and the failure of the bank
of Bombay (1866). But the peasantry gained on the whole
more than they lost, and the trade of Bombay was not permanently
injured. Sir Bartle Frere encouraged the completion
of the great trunk lines of railways, and with the funds obtained
by the demolition of the town walls (1862) he began the magnificent
series of public buildings that now adorn Bombay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span></p>

<p>During recent times the entire history of Bombay has been
sadly affected by plague and famine. Bubonic plague, of a
fatal and contagious nature, first broke out in Bombay City in
September 1896, and, despite all the efforts of the government,
quickly spread to the surrounding country. Down to the end
of October 1902 over 531,000 deaths had taken place due to
plague. In 1903-1904 there were 426,387 cases with 316,523
deaths, and 1904-1905 there were 285,897 cases with 212,948
deaths. The great cities of Bombay, Karachi and Poona
suffered most severely. A few districts in Gujarat almost
entirely escaped; but the mortality was very heavy in Satara,
Thana, Surat, Poona, Kolaba, and in the native states of Cutch,
Baroda, Kolhapur and Palanpur. The only sanitary measure
that can be said to have been successful was complete migration,
which could only be adopted in villages and smaller towns.
Inoculation was extensively tried in some cases. Segregation
was the one general method of fighting the disease; but, unfortunately,
it was misunderstood by the people and led to some
deplorable outbreaks. In Poona, during 1897, two European
officials were assassinated; the editor of a prominent native
paper was sentenced to imprisonment for sedition; and two
leaders of the Brahman community were placed in confinement.
At Bombay, in March 1898, a riot begun by Mahommedan
weavers was not suppressed until several Europeans had been
fatally injured. In Nasik district, in January 1898, the native
chairman of the plague committee was brutally murdered by a
mob. But on the whole the people submitted with characteristic
docility to the sanitary regulations of the government. Bombay,
like the Central Provinces, suffered from famine twice within
three years. The failure of the monsoon of 1896 caused widespread
distress throughout the Deccan, over an area of 46,000
sq. m., with a population of 7 millions. The largest number of
persons on relief was 301,056 in September 1897; and the total
expenditure on famine relief was Rs. 1,28,000,000. The measures
adopted were signally successful, both in saving life and in
mitigating distress. In 1899 the monsoon again failed in
Gujarat, where famine hitherto had been almost unknown;
and the winter rains failed in the Deccan, so that distress
gradually spread over almost the entire presidency. The worst
feature was a virulent outbreak of cholera in Gujarat, especially
in the native states. In April 1900 the total number of persons
in receipt of relief was 1,281,159 in British districts, 566,671
in native states, and 71,734 in Baroda. For 1900-1901 the
total expenditure on famine relief was nearly 3 crores (say,
£2,000,000 sterling); and a continuance of drought necessitated
an estimate of 1 crore in the budget of the following year. The
Bombay government exhausted its balances in 1897, and was
subsequently dependent on grants from the government of
India.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOMBAZINE,<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Bombasine</span>, a stuff originally made of silk
or silk and wool, and now also made of cotton and wool or of wool
alone. Good bombazine is made with a silk warp and a worsted
weft. It is twilled or corded and used for dress-material. Black
bombazine has been used largely for mourning, but the material
has gone out of fashion. The word is derived from the obsolete
French <i>bombasin</i>, applied originally to silk but afterwards to
&ldquo;tree-silk&rdquo; or cotton. Bombazine is said to have been made
in England in Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, and early in the 19th

French diplomatist and ecclesiastic, was the son of the comte de
Bombelles, tutor and guardian of the duke of Orleans. He was
born at Bitsch in Lorraine, and served in the army through the
Seven Years&rsquo; War. In 1765 he entered the diplomatic service,
and after several diplomatic missions became ambassador of
France to Portugal in 1786, being charged to win over that
country to the Family Compact; but the madness of the queen
and then the death of the king prevented his success. He was
transferred to Vienna early in 1789, but the Revolution cut short
his diplomatic career, and he was deprived of his post in
September 1790. He remained attached to Louis XVI., and
was employed on secret missions to other sovereigns, to gain
their aid for Louis. In 1792 he emigrated, and after Valmy
lived in retirement in Switzerland. In 1804, after the death of
his wife, he withdrew to the monastery of Brünn in Austria, and
became bishop of Oberglogau in Prussia. In 1815 he returned
to France, and became bishop of Amiens (1819). He died in
Paris in 1822.</p>

typography. Among other great enterprises, he published the
<i>editio princeps</i> (1516-1517) of the rabbinical Bible (Hebrew text

<p><span class="bold">BONA, JOHN<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> (1609-1674), Italian cardinal and author, was
born at Mondovi in Piedmont, on the 10th of October 1609. In
1624 he joined the Congregation of Feuillants and was successively
elected prior of Asti, abbot of Mondovi and general of
his order. He was created cardinal in 1669 by Clement IX., and
during the conclave, which followed that pope&rsquo;s death, was
regarded as a possible candidate for the papacy. He died on the
27th of October 1674. Bona&rsquo;s writings are mainly concerned
with liturgical and devotional subjects. Of the numerous
editions of his works, the best are those of Paris (1677), Turin
(1747) and Antwerp (1777). Stores of interesting rubrical
information, interspersed with verses and prayers, are to be
found in the <i>De Libris Liturgicis</i> and the <i>Divina Psalmodia</i>;
recent advances in liturgical studies, however, have somewhat
lessened their value. The <i>De Discretione Spirituum</i> treats of
certain higher phases of mysticism; the <i>Via Compendii ad Deum</i>
was well translated in 1876 by Henry Collins, O. Cist., under the
title of <i>An Easy Way to God</i>. Sir Roger L&rsquo;Estrange&rsquo;s translation
(<i>The Guide to Heaven</i>, 1680) of the <i>Manuductio ad Coelum</i> was
reprinted in 1898, and a new edition of the <i>Principia Vitae
Christianae</i>, ed. by D. O&rsquo;Connor, appeared in 1906. The devotional

<p><span class="bold">BONA<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Bône</span>), a seaport of Algeria, in 36° 53&prime; N., 7° 46&prime; E., on
a bay of the Mediterranean, chief town of an arrondissement
in the department of Constantine, 220 m. by rail W. of Tunis,
and 136 m. N.E. of Constantine. The town, which is situated at
the foot of the wooded heights of Edugh, is surrounded with a
modern rampart erected outside the old Arab wall, the compass
of which was found too small for its growth. Much of the old
town has been demolished, and its general character now is that
of a flourishing French city. The streets are wide and well laid
out, but some are very steep. Through the centre of the town
runs a broad tree-lined promenade, the Cours Jérôme-Bertagna,
formerly the Cours National, in which are the principal buildings
&mdash;theatre, banks, hotels. At its southern end, by the quay, is a
bronze statue of Thiers, and at the northern end, the cathedral
of St Augustine, a large church built in quasi-Byzantine style.
In it is preserved a relic supposed to be the right arm of St
Augustine, brought from Pavia in 1842. The Grand Mosque,
built out of ruins of the ancient Hippo, occupies one side of
the chief square, the Place d&rsquo;Armes. There are barracks with
accommodation for 3000 men, and civil and military hospitals.
The Kasbah (citadel) stands on a hill at the north-east of the
town. The inner harbour, covering 25 acres, is surrounded by
fine quays at which vessels drawing 22 ft. can be moored. Beyond
is a spacious outer harbour, built 1857-1868 and enlarged in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>191</span>
1905-1907. Bona is in direct steamship communication with
Marseilles, and is the centre of a large commerce, ranking after
Algiers and Oran alone in Algeria. It imports general merchandise
and manufactures, and exports phosphates, iron, zinc,
barley, sheep, wool, cork, esparto, &amp;c. There are manufactories
of native garments, tapestry and leather. The marshes at the
mouths of the Seybuse and Bujema rivers, which enter the sea
to the south of Bona, have been drained by a system of canals,
to the improvement of the sanitary condition of the town, which
has the further advantage of an abundant water supply obtained
from the Edugh hills. There are cork woods and marble quarries
in the vicinity, and the valley of the Seybuse and the neighbouring
plains are rich in agricultural produce. The population of
the town of Bona in 1906 was 36,004, of the commune 42,934,
of the arrondissement, which includes La Calle (<i>q.v.</i>) and 11
other communes, 77,803.</p>

<p>Bona is identified with the ancient <i>Aphrodisium</i>, the seaport
of <i>Hippo Regius</i> or <i>Ubbo</i>, but it derives its name from the latter
city, the ruins of which, consisting of large cisterns, now restored,
and fragments of walls, are about a mile to the south of the town.
In the first three centuries of the Christian era Hippo was one
of the richest cities in Roman Africa; but its chief title to fame
is derived from its connexion with St Augustine, who lived here
as priest and bishop for thirty-five years. Hippo was captured
by the Vandals under Genseric in 431, after a siege of fourteen
months, during which Augustine died. Only the cathedral,
together with Augustine&rsquo;s library and MSS., escaped the general
destruction. The town Avas partially restored by Belisarius,
and again sacked by the Arabs in the 7th century. On the top
of the hill on which Hippo stood, a large basilica, with chancel
towards the west, dedicated to St Augustine, was opened in 1900.
An altar surmounted by a bronze statue of the saint has also
been erected among the ruins. The place was named Hippo
Regius (Royal) by the Romans because it was a favourite residence
of the Numidian kings. Bona (Arabic <i>annaba</i>, &ldquo;the city of
jujube trees&rdquo;), which has passed through many vicissitudes, was
built by the Arabs, and was for centuries a possession of the
rulers of Tunis, who built the Kasbah in 1300. From the beginning
of the 14th to the middle of the 15th century it was frequented
by Italians and Spaniards, and in the 16th it was held for some
time by Charles V., who strengthened its citadel. Thereafter
it was held in turn by Genoese, Tunisians and Algerines. From
the time of Louis XIV. to the Revolution, the French <i>Compagnie
d&rsquo;Afrique</i> maintained a very active trade with the port. The
town was occupied by the French for a few months in 1830 and
reoccupied in 1832, when Captains Armandy and Yusuf with a
small force of marines seized the Kasbah and held it for some
months until help arrived. From that time the history of Bona
is one of industrial development, greatly stimulated since 1883
by the discovery of the phosphate beds at Tebessa.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONA DEA,<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> the &ldquo;good goddess,&rdquo; an old Roman deity of
fruitfulness, both in the earth and in women. She was identified
with Fauna, and by later syncretism also with Ops and Maia&mdash;the
latter no doubt because the dedication-day of her temple
on the Aventine was 1st May (Ovid, <i>Fasti</i>, v. 149 foll.). This
temple was cared for, and the cult attended, by women only,
and the same was the case at a second celebration at the beginning
of December in the house of a magistrate with <i>imperium</i>,
which became famous owing to the profanation of these mysteries
by P. Clodius in 62 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and the political consequences of his
act. Wine and myrtle were tabooed in the cult of this deity,
and myths grew up to explain these features of the cult, of which
an account may be read in W.W. Fowler&rsquo;s <i>Roman Festivals</i>,
pp. 103 foll. Herbs with healing properties were kept in her
temple, and also snakes, the usual symbol of the medicinal art.
Her victim was a porca, as in the cults of other deities of fertility,
and was called <i>damium</i>, and we are told that the goddess herself
was known as Damia and her priestess as <i>damiatrix</i>. These
names are almost certainly Greek; Damia is found worshipped
at several places in Greece, and also at Tarentum, where there
was a festival called <i>Dameia</i>. It is thus highly probable that on
the cult of the original Roman goddess was engrafted the Greek
one of Damia, perhaps after the conquest of Tarentum (272 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>).
It is no longer possible to distinguish clearly the Greek and
Roman elements in this curious cult, though it is itself quite
intelligible as that of an Earth-goddess with mysteries attached.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONALD, LOUIS GABRIEL AMBROISE,<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> <span class="sc">Vicomte de</span> (1754-1840),
French philosopher and politician, was born at Le Monna,
near Millau in Aveyron, on the 2nd of October 1754. Disliking
the principles of the Revolution, he emigrated in 1791, joined
the army of the prince of Condé, and soon afterwards settled
at Heidelberg. There he wrote his first important work, the
highly conservative <i>Théorie du pouvoir politique et religieux</i>
(3 vols., 1796; new ed., Paris, 1854, 2 vols.), which was condemned
by the Directory. Returning to France he found himself
an object of suspicion, and was obliged to live in retirement.
In 1806 he was associated with Chateaubriand and Fiévée in
the conduct of the <i>Mercure de France</i>, and two years later was
appointed councillor of the Imperial University which he had
often attacked. After the restoration he was a member of the
council of public instruction, and from 1815 to 1822 sat in the
chamber as deputy. His speeches were on the extreme conservative
side; he even advocated a literary censorship. In
1822 he was made minister of state, and presided over the censorship
commission. In the following year he was made a peer,
a dignity which he lost through refusing to take the oath
in 1830. From 1816 he had been a member of the Academy.
He took no part in public affairs after 1830, but retired to his
seat at Le Monna, where he died on the 23rd of November 1840.</p>

<p>Bonald was one of the leading writers of the theocratic or
traditionalist school, which included de Maistre, Lamennais,
Ballanche and d&rsquo;Eckstein. His writings are mainly on social
and political philosophy, and are based ultimately on one
great principle, the divine origin of language. In his own
words, &ldquo;L&rsquo;homme pense sa parole avant de parler sa
pensée&rdquo;; the first language contained the essence of all truth.
From this he deduces the existence of God, the divine origin
and consequent supreme authority of the Holy Scriptures, and
the infallibility of the church. While this thought lies at the
root of all his speculations there is a formula of constant application.
All relations may be stated as the triad of cause,
means and effect, which he sees repeated throughout nature.
Thus, in the universe, he finds the first cause as mover, movement
as the means, and bodies as the result; in the state, power
as the cause, ministers as the means, and subjects as the effects;
in the family, the same relation is exemplified by father, mother
and children. These three terms bear specific relations to one
another; the first is to the second as the second to the third.
Thus, in the great triad of the religious world&mdash;God, the Mediator,
and Man-God is to the God-Man as the God-Man is to Man.
On this basis he constructed a system of political absolutism
which lacks two things only:&mdash;well-grounded premisses instead
of baseless hypotheses, and the acquiescence of those who were
to be subjected to it.</p>

<p>Bonald&rsquo;s style is remarkably fine; ornate, but pure and
vigorous. Many fruitful thoughts are scattered among his
works, but his system scarcely deserves the name of a philosophy.
In abstract thought he was a mere dilettante, and his strength
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>192</span>
lay in the vigour and sincerity of his statements rather than in
cogency of reasoning.</p>

<p>He had four sons. Of these, <span class="sc">Victor de Bonald</span> (1780-1871)
followed his father in his exile, was rector of the academy of
Montpellier after the restoration, but lost his post during the
Hundred Days. Regaining it at the second restoration, he
resigned finally in 1830. He wrote <i>Des vrais principes opposés
aux erreurs du XIX<span class="sp">e</span> siècle</i> (1833), <i>Moïse et les géologues
modernes</i> (1835), and a life of his father. <span class="sc">Louis Jacques
Maurice</span> (1787-1870), cardinal (1841), was condemned by the
council of state for a pastoral letter attacking Dupin the elder&rsquo;s
<i>Manuel de droit ecclésiastique</i>. In 1848 he held a memorial
service &ldquo;for those who fell gloriously in defence of civil and
religious liberty.&rdquo; In 1851 he nevertheless advocated in the
senate the maintenance of the temporal power of Rome by force
of arms. <span class="sc">Henri</span> (d. 1846) was a contributor to legitimist
journals; and <span class="sc">René</span> was interim prefect of Aveyron in 1817.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BONAPARTE, <a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span>the name of a family made famous by
Napoleon I. (<i>q.v.</i>), emperor of the French. The French form
Bonaparte was not commonly used, even by Napoleon, until
after the spring of 1796. The original name was Buonaparte,
which was borne in the early middle ages by several distinct
families in Italy. One of these, which settled at Florence before
the year 1100, divided in the 13th century into the two branches
of San Miniato and Sarzana. A member of this latter, Francesco
Buonaparte, emigrated in the middle of the 16th century to
Corsica, where his descendants continued to occupy themselves
with the affairs of law and the magistracy.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Carlo Buonaparte</span> [Charles Marie de Bonaparte] (1746-1785),
the father of Napoleon I., took his degree in law at the
university of Pisa, and after the conquest of Corsica
by the French became assessor to the royal court of
<span class="sidenote">Napoleon&rsquo;s father and mother.</span>
Ajaccio and the neighbouring districts. His restless
and dissatisfied nature led him to press or intrigue
for other posts, and to embark in risky business enterprises
which compromised the fortune of his family for many years
to come. In 1764 he married Letizia Ramolino, a beautiful and
high-spirited girl, aged fourteen, descended from a well-connected
family domiciled in Corsica since the middle of the 15th
century. The first two children, born in 1765 and 1767, died
in infancy; Joseph (see below), the first son who survived, was
born in 1768, and Napoleon in 1769. The latter was born in
the midst of the troubles consequent on the French conquest,
Letizia having recently accompanied her husband in several
journeys and escapes. Her firm and courageous disposition
showed itself at that trying time and throughout the whole
of her singularly varied career. Simple and frugal in her tastes,
and devout in thought and manner of life, she helped to bind
her children to the life of Corsica, while her husband, a schemer
by nature and a Voltairian by conviction, pointed the way to
careers in France, the opening up of which moulded the fortunes
of the family and the destinies of Europe. He died of cancer
in the stomach at Montpellier in 1785.</p>

<p>Letizia lived to witness the glory and the downfall of her great
son, surviving Napoleon I. by sixteen years. She never
accommodated herself to the part she was called on to play
during the Empire, and, though endowed with immense wealth and
distinguished by the title of <i>Madame Mère</i>, lived mainly in
retirement, and in the exercise of a strict domestic economy
which her early privations had made a second nature to her, but
which rendered her very unpopular in France and was displeasing
to Napoleon. After the events of 1814 she joined the
emperor in the island of Elba and was privy to his plans of escape,
returning to Paris during the Hundred Days. After the final
downfall of Waterloo, she took up her residence at Rome, where
Pope Pius VII. treated her with great kindness and consideration,
and protected her from the suspicious attentions of the powers
of the Grand Alliance. In 1818 she addressed a pathetic letter
to the powers assembled at the congress of Aix, petitioning for
Napoleon&rsquo;s release, on the ground that his mortal illness had
removed any possibility of his ever again becoming a menace
to the world&rsquo;s peace. The letter remained unanswered, the
powers having reason to believe that it was a mere political
move, and that its terms had been previously concerted with
Napoleon. Henceforth, saddened by the death of Napoleon,
of her daughters Pauline and Elisa, and of several grandchildren,
she lived a life of mournful seclusion. In 1829 she was crippled
by a serious fall, and was all but blind before her death in 1836.</p>

<p>The brothers and sisters of Napoleon I., taken in order of age,
are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">I. Joseph</span> (1768-1844), was born at Corte in Corsica, on the
7th of January 1768. He was educated at the college at Autun
in France, returned to Corsica in 1784, shortly after
the death of his father, and thereafter studied law at
<span class="sidenote">Napoleon&rsquo;s brothers and sisters: 1. Joseph Bonaparte.</span>
the university of Pisa. He became a barrister at
Bastia in June 1788, and was soon elected a councillor
of the municipality of Ajaccio. Like his brothers,
Napoleon and Lucien, he embraced the French or
democratic side, and on the victory of the Paolist party
fled with his family from Corsica and sought refuge in France.
After spending a short time in Paris, where he was disgusted
with the excesses of the Jacobins, he settled at Marseilles and
married Mlle Julie Clary, daughter of a merchant of that town.
The Bonapartes moved from place to place, mainly with the view
of concerting measures for the recovery of Corsica. Joseph
took part in these efforts and went on a mission to Genoa in
1795. In 1796 he accompanied his brother Napoleon in the
early part of the Italian campaign, and had some part in the
negotiations with Sardinia which led to the armistice of Cherasco
(April 28), the news of which he bore to the French government.
Later he proceeded to Leghorn, took part in the French
expedition for the recovery of Corsica, and, along with the
commissioner of the French Republic, Miot de Melito, helped
in the reorganization of that island. In March 1797 he was
appointed by the Directory, minister to the court of Parma, and
early in the summer he proceeded to Rome in the same capacity.
Discords arose between the Vatican and the French Republic,
and it is clear that Napoleon and the French Directory ordered
Joseph to encourage revolutionary movements in Rome. On
the 28th of December 1797 a disturbance took place opposite
the French embassy, which led to the death of the French
general, Léonard Duphot. Joseph at once left Rome, which
soon became a republic. Repairing to Paris, he entered on
parliamentary life, becoming one of the members for Corsica
in the Council of Five Hundred. He made no mark in the
chamber and retired in 1799.</p>

<p>Before the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of Brumaire he helped Napoleon in
making overtures to Sieyès and Moreau, but otherwise did little.
Thereafter he refused to enter the ministry, but became a member
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>193</span>
of the council of state and of the <i>Corps Législatif</i>, where his
advice on the state of public opinion was frequently useful. He
had a hand in the negotiations for the Concordat, but, according
to Lucien Bonaparte, looked on that measure as &ldquo;ill-advised
and retrograde.&rdquo; His services in the diplomatic sphere were
more important. At Mortfontaine, his country-house, he concluded
with the envoy of the United States a convention which
bears that name (1800). He also presided over the negotiations
which led to the treaty of Lunéville with Austria (February 9,
1801); and he and Maret represented France in the lengthy
discussions with the British envoy, Lord Cornwallis, which
resulted in the signature of the treaty of Amiens (March 25,
1802). This diplomatic triumph in its turn led to the
consolidation of Napoleon&rsquo;s power as First Consul for life (August
1, 1802) with the chief voice in the selection of his successor.
On this question the brothers disagreed. As neither Joseph
nor Napoleon had a male heir, the eldest brother, whose ideas
of primogeniture were very strict, claimed to be recognized as
heir, while Napoleon wished to recognize the son of Louis
Bonaparte. On the proclamation of the French empire (May
1804) the friction became acute. Napoleon offered to make
Joseph king of Lombardy if he would waive all claim of
succession to the French throne, but met with a firm refusal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Joseph had striven earnestly, but in vain, to
avert a rupture with England, which came about in May 1803.
In 1805 he acted as chief of the French government while
Napoleon was campaigning in Germany. Early in 1806 he
proceeded to Naples with a French force in order to expel the
Bourbon dynasty from southern Italy, Napoleon adding the
promise that the Neapolitan crown would be for Joseph if he
chose to accept it. The conquest of the mainland was speedily
effected, though Gaëta, Reggio and the rock of Scylla held out
for some months. The Bourbon court retired to Sicily, where
it had the protection of a British force. By the decree of the
30th of March 1806 Napoleon proclaimed Joseph king of Naples,
but allowed him to keep intact his claims to the throne of France.
In several letters he enjoined his brother to greater firmness in
his administration: &ldquo;These peoples in Italy, and in general all
nations, if they do not find their masters, are disposed to
rebellion and mutiny.&rdquo; The memoirs of Count Miot de Melito,
whom Joseph appointed minister of war, show how great were
the difficulties with which the new monarch had to contend&mdash;an
almost bankrupt treasury, a fickle and degraded populace,
Bourbon intrigues and plots, and frequent attacks by the British
from Sicily. General Stuart&rsquo;s victory at Maida (July 3)
shook Joseph&rsquo;s throne to its base; but the surrender of Gaëta
soon enabled Massena to march southwards and subdue Calabria.
During his brief reign at Naples, Joseph effected many
improvements; he abolished the relics of feudalism, reformed the
monastic orders, reorganized the judicial, financial and educational
systems, and initiated several public works. In everything
he showed his desire to carry out the aims which he expressed
to his consort in April 1806: &ldquo;Justice demands that I should
make this people as happy as the scourge of war will permit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From these well-meant, but not always successful, efforts he
was suddenly called away by Napoleon to take the crown of
Spain (May 1808). There his difficulties were far greater.
Despite the benevolent intentions announced to the Spaniards
in his proclamation dated Bayonne, 23rd of June 1808, all
reconciliation between them and the French was impossible after
Napoleon&rsquo;s treatment of their <i>de facto</i> king, Ferdinand VII.
For the varying fortunes of King Joseph in Spain and in the
eventful years of the Peninsular War, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spain</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Peninsular
War</a></span>. His sovereignty was little more than titular. Compelled
to leave Madrid hastily in August 1808, owing to the Spanish
success at Baylen, he was reinstated by Napoleon at the close
of the year; and he was thereafter kept in a subordinate position
which led him on four occasions to offer to abdicate. The
emperor took no notice of these offers, and ordered him to govern
with more energy. Between February and May 1810 the emperor
placed the northern and north-eastern provinces under the
command of French generals as military districts, virtually
independent of Joseph&rsquo;s authority. Again the king protested,
but in vain. As his trusted adviser, Miot de Melito, observed in
his memoirs, Joseph tried to be constitutional king of Spain,
whereas after the experience of the years 1808-1809 he could
only succeed in the Peninsula by becoming &ldquo;the mere instrument
of a military power.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bearing a title which was only an
oppressive burden, the king had in reality ceased to exist as a
monarch, and barely retained some semblance of authority over
a small part of the French army as a general. Reduced by the
exhausted state of his treasury to the last extremity he at length
seriously thought of departure.&rdquo; Joseph took this step in April
1811, and proceeded to Paris in order to extort better terms, or
offer his abdication; but he had to return with a monthly subsidy
of 500,000 francs and the promise that the army of the centre
(the smallest of the five French armies) should be under his
control. Late in that year Napoleon united Catalonia to France.
Wellington&rsquo;s victory at Salamanca (July 22, 1812) compelled
Joseph to leave his capital; and despite the retirement of the
British in the autumn of that year, Joseph&rsquo;s authority never fully
recovered from that blow. The end of his nominal rule came in
the next year, when Wellington utterly overthrew the chief
French army, commanded by King Joseph and Marshal Jourdan,
at Vittoria (June 21, 1813). The king fled from Spain, was
disgraced by Napoleon, and received the order to retire incognito
to Mortfontaine. The emperor wrote to the minister of war
(July 11, 1813):&mdash;&ldquo;His [Joseph&rsquo;s] behaviour has never ceased
bringing misfortune upon my army; it is time to make an
end of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Napoleon was equally dissatisfied with his brother&rsquo;s conduct
as lieutenant-general of France, while he himself was conducting
the campaign of 1814 in the east of France. On the 30th of
March, Joseph empowered Marmont to make a truce with the
assailants of Paris if they should be in overpowering strength.
On the surrender of the capital Joseph at once retired. The part
which he played during the Hundred Days (1815) was also
insignificant. It is strange that, four days after Waterloo,
Napoleon should have urged him to inspirit the Chamber of
Deputies with a view to a national resistance (<i>Lettres nouvelles
de Napoléon</i>). In point of fact Joseph did little beyond seeking
to further the emperor&rsquo;s plans of escape to America. After the
surrender of his brother to the captain of H.M.S. &ldquo;Bellerophon&rdquo;
at Rochefort, Joseph went to the United States. Settling in
Bordentown, New Jersey, he adopted the title of comte de
Survilliers, and sought to promote plans for the rescue of his
brother from St Helena. In 1830 he pleaded, but unsuccessfully,
for the recognition of the claims of the duke of Reichstadt (king
of Rome) to the French throne. He afterwards visited England,
and for a time resided at Genoa and Florence. In the latter city,
the cradle of his race, he died on the 28th of July 1844. In
person he somewhat resembled Napoleon, but utterly lacked his
strength and energy. He was fitted for an embassy or judgeship,
but was too mild, supine and luxurious for the tasks thrust upon
him by his brother. Yet his correspondence and memoirs prove
that he retained for Napoleon warm feelings of affection.</p>

<p><span class="sc">II. Lucien</span> (1775-1840), prince of Canino, was born at Ajaccio
on the 21st of May 1775. He followed his elder brothers
to the schools of Autun and Brienne. At that time he
wished to enter the French army, but, being debarred
<span class="sidenote">2. Lucien Bonaparte</span>
by defective sight, was destined for the church, and
with this aim in view went to the seminary at Aix in Provence
(1786). His excitable and volatile disposition agreed ill with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>
discipline of the place, and on the outbreak of the Revolution in
1789 he eagerly espoused the democratic and anti-clerical movement
then sweeping over France. On returning to Corsica he
became the leading speaker in the Jacobin club at Ajaccio.
Pushing even Napoleon to more decided action, Lucien urged
his brothers to break with Paoli, the leader of the more conservative
party, which sought to ally itself with England as
against the regicide republic of France. He headed a Corsican
deputation which went to France in order to denounce Paoli
and to solicit aid for the democrats; but, on the Paolists gaining
the upper hand, the Bonapartes left the island and joined Lucien
at Toulon. In the south of France he worked hard for the
Jacobinical cause, and figured as &ldquo;Brutus&rdquo; in the Jacobin club
of the small town of St Maximin (then renamed Marathon).
There on the 4th of May 1794 he married Mlle Catherine
Boyer, though he was a minor and had not the consent of his
family&mdash;an act which brought him into a state almost approaching
disgrace and penury. The <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of Thermidor (July
28, 1794) compelled the young disciple of Robespierre hurriedly
to leave St Maximin, and to accept a small post at St Chamans.
There he was arrested and imprisoned for a time until Napoleon&rsquo;s
influence procured his release, and further gained for him a post
as commissioner in the French army campaigning in Germany.
Lucien soon conceived a dislike for a duty which opened up no
vista for his powers of oratory and political intrigue, and repaired
to Corsica. In the hope of being elected a deputy of the island,
he refused an appointment offered by Napoleon in the army of
Egypt in 1798. His hopes were fulfilled, and in 1798 he entered
the Council of Five Hundred at Paris. There his vivacious
eloquence brought him into prominence, and he was president
of that body on the eventful day of the 19th of Brumaire
(November 10) 1799, when Napoleon overthrew the national
councils of France at the palace of St Cloud. The refusal of
Lucien to put the vote of outlawry, for which the majority of
the council clamoured, his opportune closing of the sitting, and
his appeal to the soldiers outside to disperse <i>les représentants
du poignard</i>, turned the scale in favour of his brother.</p>

<p>By a strange irony this event, the chief event of Lucien&rsquo;s life,
was fatal to the cause of democracy of which he had been the
most eager exponent. In one of his earlier letters to his brother
Joseph, Lucien stated that he had detected in Napoleon &ldquo;an
ambition not altogether egotistic but which surpassed his love
for the general weal; ... in case of a counter-revolution he
would try to ride on the crest of events.&rdquo; Napoleon having by
his help triumphed over parliamentary institutions in France,
Lucien&rsquo;s suspicion of his brother became a dominant feeling;
and the relations between them became strained during the
period of the consulate (1799-1804). He accepted office as
minister of the interior, but was soon deprived of it owing to
political and personal differences with the First Consul. In
order to soften the blow, Napoleon appointed him ambassador
to the court of Madrid (November 1800). There again Lucien
displeased his brother. France and Spain were then about to
partition Portugal, and the Spanish forces were beginning to
invade that land, when the court of Lisbon succeeded, owing
(it is said) to the free use of bribes, in inducing Godoy, the
Spanish minister, and Lucien Bonaparte to sign the preliminaries
of peace on the 6th of June 1801 at Badajoz. The First Consul,
finding his plans of seizing Lisbon frustrated, remonstrated with
his brother, who thereupon resigned his post, and returned to
Paris, there taking part in the opposition which the Tribunate
offered to some of Napoleon&rsquo;s schemes. Lucien&rsquo;s next proceeding
completed the breach between the two brothers. His wife had
died in 1800; he became enamoured of a Mme Jouberthou in
the early summer of 1802, made her his mistress, and finally,
despite the express prohibition of the First Consul, secretly
married her at his residence of Plessis (on October 23, 1803).
At that time Napoleon was pressing Lucien for important
reasons of state to marry the widow of the king of Etruria, and
on hearing of his brother&rsquo;s action he ordered him to leave French
territory. Lucien departed for Italy with his wife and infant
son, after annoying Napoleon by bestowing on her publicly the
name of Bonaparte. He also charged Joseph never to try to
reconcile Napoleon to him.</p>

<p>For some years he lived in Italy, chiefly at Rome, showing
marked hostility to the emperor. In December 1807 the latter
sought to come to an arrangement by which Lucien would take
his place as a French prince, provided that he would annul his
marriage. This step Lucien refused to take; and after residing
for some time at his estate of Canino, from which he took the
papal title of prince of Canino, he left for America. Captured
by a British ship, he was taken to Malta and thence to England,
where he resided under some measure of surveillance up to the
peace of 1814. Returning to Rome, he offered Napoleon his
help during the Hundred Days (1815), stood by his side at the
&ldquo;Champ de Mai&rdquo; at Paris, and was the last to defend his prerogatives
at the time of his second abdication. He spent the
rest of his life in Italy, and died at Rome on the 29th of June
1840. His family comprised four sons and six daughters. He
wrote an epic, <i>Charlemagne, ou l&rsquo;Église délivreé</i> (2 vols., 1814),
also <i>La Vérité sur les Cent Jours</i> and <i>Memoirs</i>, which were not
completed.</p>

the 3rd of January 1777. Owing to the efforts of her brothers
she entered the establishment of St Cyr near Paris
as a &ldquo;king&rsquo;s scholar.&rdquo; On its disruption by the
<span class="sidenote">3. Elisa.</span>
revolutionists in 1792 Napoleon took charge of her and
brought her back to Ajaccio. She shared the fortunes of the
family in the south of France, and on the 5th of May 1797
married Felix Bacciochi, a well-connected Corsican. In 1805,
after the foundation of the French empire, Napoleon bestowed
upon her the principality of Piombino and shortly afterwards
Lucca; in 1808 her importunities gained for her the grand
duchy of Tuscany. Bacciochi being almost a nullity, her pride
and ability had a great influence on the administration and on
Italian affairs in general. Her relations with Napoleon were
frequently strained; and in 1813-1814 she abetted Murat in his
enterprises (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Murat</a></span>). After her brother&rsquo;s fall she retired,
with the title of countess of Compignano, first to Bologna and
afterwards to Santo Andrea near Trieste, where she died on the
6th of August 1820.</p>

<p>IV. Louis (1778-1846) was born at Ajaccio on the 2nd of
September 1778. His elder brother Napoleon supervised
his education with much care, gaining for him scholarships
to the royal military schools of France, and during
<span class="sidenote">4. Louis Bonaparte.</span>
the time when the elder brother was a lieutenant in
garrison at Auxonne Louis shared his scanty fare. In 1795
Napoleon procured for him admission to the military school at
Châlons, and wrote thus of the boy:&mdash;&ldquo;I am very pleased with
Louis; he fulfils my hopes; intelligence, warmth, good health,
talent, good address, kindness&mdash;he possesses all these qualities.&rdquo;
Louis went through the Italian campaign of 1796-97 with
Napoleon and acted as his aide-de-camp in Egypt in 1798-99.
In 1802 the First Consul married him to Hortense Beauharnais,
a forced union which led to most deplorable results. In 1804
Louis was raised to the rank of general, and entered the council
of state in order to perfect his knowledge of administrative
affairs. In the next year he became governor of Paris and undertook
various military and administrative duties.</p>

<p>After the victory of Austerlitz (December 2, 1805) Napoleon
began to plan the formation of a ring of states surrounding, and
in close alliance with, the French empire. He destined Louis for
the throne of Holland, and proclaimed him king of that country
on the 6th of June 1806. From the first the emperor reproached
him with being too easy with his subjects and with courting
popularity too much. The increasing rigour of the continental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span>
system brought the two brothers to an open rupture. Their
relations were embittered by a violent jealousy which Louis
conceived against his wife. In 1808 the emperor offered Louis
the throne of Spain then vacant; but on Louis refusing to
accept it the honour went to Joseph. The dispute between
Louis and the emperor continued. In the latter part of 1809
Napoleon virtually resolved to annex Holland, in order to stop
the trade which the Dutch secretly carried on with England.
At the close of the year Louis went to Paris, partly in order to
procure a divorce from Hortense and partly to gain better
terms for Holland. He failed in both respects. In January
1810 Napoleon annexed the island of Walcheren, alleging that
Louis had not done his share in defending the interests of France
at the time of the British Walcheren expedition (1809). The
French troops also occupied Breda and Bergen-op-Zoom. Louis
gave way on all the points in dispute; but his acquiescence only
postponed the crisis. After the collapse of negotiations with
Great Britain in the spring of 1810, the emperor again pressed
Louis hard, and finally sent French troops against the Dutch
capital. Thereupon Louis, despairing of offering resistance,
fled from his kingdom and finally settled at Töplitz in Bohemia.
On the 9th of July 1810 Napoleon annexed Holland to the
French empire. Louis spent the rest of his life separated from
his wife, and in 1815 gained the custody of his elder son. He
lived chiefly at Rome, concerning himself with literary and
philosophic studies and with the fortunes of his sons. Their
devotion to the national and democratic cause in Italy in 1830-1831
gave him much pleasure, which was overclouded by the
death of the elder, Napoleon Louis, in the spring campaign of
1831 in the Romagna. The failure of his other son, Charles
Louis Napoleon (afterwards Napoleon III.), to wrest the French
crown from Louis Philippe by the attempts at Strassburg and
Boulogne also caused him much disappointment. He died on
the 25th of July 1846 and was buried at St Leu. Under more
favourable conditions Louis would have gained a name for
kindness and philanthropy, proofs of which did indeed appear
during his reign in Holland and gained him the esteem of his
subjects; but his morbid sensitiveness served to embitter his
relations both of a domestic and of a political nature and to sour
his own disposition. His literary works are unimportant. His
sons were Napoleon Charles (1802-1807), Napoleon Louis (1804-1831),
and Charles Louis Napoleon (1808-1873), afterwards
emperor of the French as <span class="sc">Napoleon III</span>. (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

soon tired of him, returned to Paris and gratified her whims in
ways that caused some scandal. In 1806 she received the title of
duchess of Guastalla. Her offhand treatment of the new empress,
Marie Louise, in 1810 led to her removal from court. Nevertheless
in 1814 she repaired with &ldquo;Madame Mère&rdquo; to Elba, and is said
to have expressed a wish to share Napoleon&rsquo;s exile in St Helena.

this capital from Paris displeased Caroline; her relations with
Napoleon became strained, and she associated herself with the
equivocal movements of her husband in 1814-1815. Before
his tragic end at Pizzo on the 13th of October 1815, she had
retired to Austrian territory and was placed under some measure

<p><span class="sc">VII. Jerome</span> (1784-1860) was born at Ajaccio on the
15th of November 1784; he shared the fortunes of the family in
the early years of the French Revolution, was then
educated at Juilly and was called to the side of his
<span class="sidenote">7. Jerome Bonaparte.</span>
brother, then First Consul of France, in 1800. Many
stories are told illustrating his impetuous but affectionate
nature. While in the Consular Guard he fought a duel with
the younger brother of General Davout and was wounded. Soon
afterwards he was transferred to the navy and cruised in the
West Indies, until, when blockaded by a British cruiser, he left
his ship and travelled through the United States. At Baltimore
he fell in love with Miss Elizabeth Patterson, and, though a minor,
married her. This disregard of discipline and of the laws of
France greatly annoyed Napoleon; and when in 1805 Jerome
brought his wife to Europe, the emperor ordered her to be
excluded from his states. Jerome vainly sought to bend his
brother&rsquo;s will in an interview at Alexandria. In May 1805 he
received command of a small squadron in the Mediterranean,
while his wife proceeded to Camberwell, where she gave birth to a
son. In November Jerome sailed in a squadron commanded by
Admiral Willaumez, which was to ravage the West Indies; but it
was scattered by a storm. After damaging British commerce in
the North Atlantic, Jerome reached France with his ship in
safety in August 1806. Napoleon made him a prince of France,
and gave him command of a division of South Germans in the
campaign of 1806. After Jena, Jerome received the surrender of
several Prussian towns. An imperial decree having annulled the
Patterson marriage, the emperor united Jerome to the princess
Catherine of Württemberg; and in pursuance of the terms of
the treaty of Tilsit (July 7, 1807) raised him to the throne of the
new kingdom of Westphalia. There Jerome, though frequently
rebuked by the emperor, displayed his fondness for luxury,
indulged in numerous <i>amours</i> and ran deeply into debt. In
some respects his kingdom benefited by the connexion with
France. Feudalism was abolished; the <i>Code Napoléon</i> was
introduced; the Jews were freed from repressive laws; and
education received some impulse in its higher departments.
But the unpopularity of Jerome&rsquo;s rule was shown by the part
taken by the peasants in the abortive rising headed by Baron
Wilhelm von Dörnberg and other Westphalian officers in April
1809. Despite heavy taxation, the state debt increased greatly;
and the sending of a contingent to Russia in 1812 brought the
state to the verge of bankruptcy. In the early part of that
campaign Jerome was entrusted with an important movement
which might have brought the southern Russian army into grave
danger; on his failure (which was probably due to his lack of
energy) the emperor promptly subjected him to the control of
Marshal Davout, and Jerome returned to Cassel. In 1813, on the
fall of the Napoleonic régime in Germany, Jerome retired to
France, and in 1814 spent some time in Switzerland and at
Trieste. Returning to France in 1815, he commanded a division
on the French left wing at Waterloo and attacked Hougomont
with great pertinacity. On Napoleon&rsquo;s second abdication
Jerome proceeded to Württemberg, was threatened with arrest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>196</span>
unless he gave up his wife and child, and was kept under
surveillance at Goppingen; finally he was allowed to proceed to
Augsburg, and thereafter resided at Trieste, or in Italy or
Switzerland. His consort died in 1835. He returned to France in 1847,
and after the rise of Louis Napoleon to power, became successively
governor of the Invalides, marshal of France and president
of the senate. He died on the 24th of June 1860. His children
were Jerome Napoleon (see XIV.), Mathilde (see XII.) and
Napoleon Joseph Charles Paul (born in 1822); the last was
afterwards known as Prince Napoleon (see XI. below) and finally
became the heir to the fortunes of the Napoleonic dynasty.</p>

<p><span class="sc">VIII. Charles Lucien Jules Laurent</span> (1803-1857), prince
of Canino, son of Lucien Bonaparte, was a scientist rather than a
politician. He married his cousin, Zénaïde Bonaparte,
daughter of Joseph, in 1822. At the age of twenty-two
<span class="sidenote">Descendants of Lucien: 8. Charles.</span>
he began the publication of an <i>American Ornithology</i>
(4 vols., Philadelphia, 1825-1833), which established
his scientific reputation. A series of other works in zoology
followed: <i>Iconographia della fauna Italica</i> (3 vols., Rome, 1832-1841),
<i>Catalogo metodico degli uccelli europei</i> (1 vol., Bologna, 1842),
<i>Catalogo metodico dei pesci europei</i> (1 vol., Naples, 1845, 4to),
<i>Catalogo metodico dei mammiferi europei</i> (1 vol., Milan, 1845),
<i>Telachorum tabula analytica</i> (Neufchatel, 1838). He was
elected honorary member of the academy of Upsala in 1833, of
that of Berlin in 1843, and correspondent of the Institute of
France in 1844. Towards 1847 he took part in the political
agitation in Italy, and presided over scientific congresses,
notably at Venice, where he declared himself in favour of the
independence of Italy and the expulsion of the Austrians. He
entered the Junto of Rome in 1848 and was elected deputy by
Viterbo to the national assembly. The failure of the revolution
forced him to leave Italy in July 1849. He gained Holland, then
France, where he turned again to science. His principal works were,
<i>Conspectus systematis ornithologiae, mastozologiae, erpetologiae
et amphibologiae, Ichthyologiae</i> (Leiden, 1850), <i>Tableau des
oiseaux-mouches</i> (Paris, 1854), <i>Ornithologie fossile</i> (Paris, 1858).
Eight children survived him: Joseph Lucien Charles Napoleon,
prince of Canino (1824-1865), who died without heirs; Lucien
Louis Joseph Napoleon, born in 1828, who took holy orders in
1853 and became a cardinal in 1868; Julie Charlotte Zénaïde
Pauline Laetitia Désirée Bartholomée, who married the marquis
of Roccagiovine; Charlotte Honorine Josephine, who married
Count Primoli; Marie Désirée Eugénie Josephine Philomène,
who married the count Campello; Auguste Amélie Maximilienne
Jacqueline, who married Count Gabrielli; Napoleon Charles
Grégoire Jacques Philippe, born in 1839, who married the
princess Ruspoli, by whom he had two daughters; and Bathilde
Aloyse Léonie, who married the comte de Cambacérès. The
branch is now extinct.</p>

<p><span class="sc">IX. Louis Lucien</span> (1813-1891), son of Lucien Bonaparte,
was born at Thorngrove, Worcestershire, England, on the
4th of January 1813. He passed his youth in England, not
going to France until 1848, when, after the revolution,
<span class="sidenote">9. Louis Lucien.</span>
he was elected deputy for Corsica on the 28th of
November 1848; his election having been invalidated, he was
returned as deputy for the Seine in June 1849. He sat in the right
of the Legislative Assembly, but had no direct part in the <i>coup
d&rsquo;état</i> of his cousin on the 2nd of December 1851. Napoleon III.
named him senator and prince, but he took hardly any part in
politics during the Second Empire, and after the proclamation of
the Third Republic in 1870 he withdrew to England. There he
busied himself with philology, and published notably some works
on the Basque language: <i>Grammaire basque, Remarques sur
plusieurs assertions concernant la langue basque</i> (1876),
<i>Observations sur le basque Fontarabie</i> (1878). He died
on the 3rd of November 1891, leaving no children.</p>

<p><span class="sc">X. Pierre Napoleon</span> (1815-1881), son of Lucien Bonaparte,
was born at Rome on the 12th of September 1815. He
began his life of adventure at the age of fifteen, joining
the insurrectionary bands in the Romagna (1830-1831);
<span class="sidenote">10. Pierre.</span>
was then in the United States, where he went to join
his uncle Joseph, and in Colombia with General Santander
(1832). Returning to Rome he was taken prisoner by order
of the pope (1835-1836). He finally took refuge in England.
At the revolution of 1848 he returned to France and was elected
deputy for Corsica to the Constituent Assembly. He declared
himself an out-and-out republican and voted even with the
socialists. He pronounced himself in favour of the national
workshops and against the <i>loi Falloux</i>. His attitude
contributed greatly to give popular confidence to his cousin Louis
Napoleon (Napoleon III.), of whose <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> on the 2nd
of December 1851 he disapproved; but he was soon reconciled to the
emperor, and accepted the title of prince. The republicans at
once abandoned him. From that time on he led a debauched life,
and lost all political importance. He turned to literature and
published some mediocre poems. In January 1870 a violent
incident brought him again into prominence. As the result
of a controversy with Paschal Grousset, the latter sent him two
journalists to provoke him to a duel. Pierre Bonaparte took
them personally to account, and during a violent discussion
he drew his revolver and killed one of them, Victor Noir. This
crime greatly excited the republican press, which demanded his
trial. The High Court acquitted him, and criticism then fell
upon the government. Pierre Bonaparte died in obscurity
at Versailles on the 7th of April 1881. He had married the
daughter of a Paris working-man, Justine Eleanore Ruffin, by
whom he had, before his marriage, two children: (1) Roland
Napoleon, born on the 19th of May 1858, who entered the army,
was excluded from it in 1886, and then devoted himself to
geography and scientific explorations; (2) Jeanne, wife of the
marquis de Vence.</p>

<p><span class="sc">XI. Napoleon Joseph Charles Paul</span>, commonly known
as Prince Napoleon, or by the sobriquet of &ldquo;Plon-Plon,&rdquo;<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
(1822-1891), was the second son of Jerome Bonaparte,
king of Westphalia, by his wife Catherine, princess
<span class="sidenote">Descendants of Jerome: 11. Prince Napoleon (Plon-Plon).</span>
of Württemberg, and was born at Trieste on the
9th of September 1822. He soon rendered himself
popular by his advanced democratic ideas, which
he expressed on all possible occasions. After the
French revolution of 1848 he was elected to the
National Assembly as a representative of Corsica, and (his elder
brother, Jerome Napoleon Charles, dying in 1847) assumed the
name of Jerome. Notwithstanding his ostensible opposition
to the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of 1851, he was designated, upon the
establishment of the Empire, as successor to the throne if
Napoleon III. should die childless, and received a liberal
dotation, but was allowed no share in public affairs. Privately he
professed himself the representative of the Napoleonic tradition
in its democratic aspect, and associated mainly with men of
advanced political opinions. At court he represented the Liberal
party against the empress Eugénie. In 1854 he took part in the
Crimean campaign as general of division. His conduct at the
battle of the Alma occasioned imputations upon his personal
courage, but they seem to have been entirely groundless. Returning
to France he undertook the chief direction of the National
Exhibition of 1855, in which he manifested great capacity.
In 1858 he was appointed minister for the Colonies and Algeria,
and his administration aroused great hopes, but his activity
was diverted into a different channel by his sudden marriage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span>
in January 1859 with the princess Marie Clotilde of Savoy,
daughter of Victor Emmanuel, a prelude to the war for the
liberation of Italy. In this war Prince Napoleon commanded
the French corps that occupied Tuscany, and it was expected
that he would become ruler of the principality, but he refused
to exert any pressure upon the inhabitants, who preferred union
with the Italian kingdom. The next few years were chiefly
distinguished by remarkable speeches which displayed the prince
in the unexpected character of a great orator. Unfortunately
his indiscretion equalled his eloquence: one speech (1861) sent
him to America to avoid a duel with the duke d&rsquo;Aumale; another
(1865), in which he justly but intemperately protested against
the Mexican expedition, cost him all his official dignities.
Nevertheless he was influential in effecting the reform by which in
1869 it was sought to reconcile the Empire with Liberal principles.
The fatal war of 1870 was resolved upon during his absence
in Norway, and was strongly condemned by him. After the
first disasters he undertook an ineffectual mission to Italy to
implore the aid of his father-in-law; and after the fall of the
Empire lived in comparative retirement until in 1879 the death
of Napoleon III.&rsquo;s son, the Prince Imperial (see XIII. below),
made him direct heir to the Napoleonic succession. His part as
imperial pretender was unfortunate and inglorious: his democratic
opinions were unacceptable to the imperial party, and
before his death he was virtually deposed in favour of his son
Prince Napoleon Victor, who, supported by Paul de Cassagnac
and others, openly declared himself a candidate for the throne
in 1884. He died at Rome on the 17th of March 1891. In the
character of his intellect, as in personal appearance, he bore
an extraordinary resemblance to the first Napoleon, possessing
the same marvellous lucidity of insight, and the same gift of
infallibly distinguishing the essential from the non-essential.
He was a warm friend of literature and art, and in a private
station would have achieved high distinction as a man of letters.</p>

<p>His eldest son, Prince Napoleon Victor Jérome Frédéric (b. 1862),
became at his death the recognized head of the French
Bonapartist party. The second son, Prince Louis Napoleon, an
officer in the Russian army, showed a steadier disposition, and
was more favoured in some monarchist quarters; in 1906 he
was made governor of the Caucasus.</p>

<p><span class="sc">XII. Mathilde Letitia Wilhelmine</span> (1820-1904), daughter
of Jerome, and sister of Prince Napoleon (XI.), was born at
Trieste on the 20th of May 1820; after being almost
betrothed to her cousin Louis Napoleon, in 1840 she
<span class="sidenote">12. Mathilde.</span>
was married to Prince Anatole Demidov. His conduct,
however, led to a separation within five years, and the tsar
Nicholas compelled him to make Princess Mathilde a handsome
allowance. After the election of Louis Napoleon to the presidency
of the republic she took up her residence in Paris, and
did the honours of the Élysée till his marriage. She continued
to live in Paris, having great influence as a friend and patron of
men of art and letters, till her death on the 2nd of January 1904.</p>

<p><span class="sc">XIII. Napoleon Eugene Louis Jean Joseph</span> (1856-1879),
Prince Imperial, only son of the emperor Napoleon III.
and the empress Eugénie, was born at Paris on the 16th
of March 1856. He was a delicate boy, but when the
<span class="sidenote">13. Prince Imperial: son of Napoleon III.</span>
war of 1870 broke out his mother sent him to the army,
to win popularity for him, and the government journals
vaunted his bravery. After the first defeats he had
to flee from France with the empress, and settled in England
at Chislehurst, completing his military education at Woolwich.
On the death of his father on the 9th of January 1873 the
Imperialists proclaimed him Napoleon IV., and he became
the official Pretender. He was naturally inactive, but he was
influenced by his mother on the one hand, and by the Bonapartist
leaders in France on the other. They thought that he should
win his crown by military prestige, and he was persuaded to
attach himself as a volunteer to the English expedition to
Zululand in February 1879. It was a blunder to have allowed him
to go, and the blunder ended in a tragedy, for while out on a
reconnaissance with a few troopers they were surprised by Zulus,
and the Prince Imperial was killed (June 1, 1879). His body
was brought back to England, and buried at Chislehurst.</p>

<p><span class="sc">XIV. The Bonapartes of Baltimore</span> are a branch of the
family settled in America, descended from Jerome Bonaparte
(VII.) by his union with Elizabeth (b. 1785), daughter of William
Patterson, a Baltimore merchant, probably descended from the
Robert Paterson who was the original of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;Old
Mortality.&rdquo; The marriage took place at Baltimore on the 24th of
December 1803, but it was greatly disliked by Napoleon, who
refused to recognize its legality. However, it was valid according
to American law, and Pope Pius VII. refused to declare it void.
Nevertheless Jerome was forced by his brother to separate
himself from his wife, whom he had brought to Europe, and
after a stay in England Madame Patterson, or Madame Bonaparte,
as she was usually called, returned to Baltimore. She died
in 1879. Jerome&rsquo;s only child by this marriage was Jerome
Napoleon Bonaparte (1805-1870), who was born in England,
but resided chiefly in Baltimore, and is said to have shown
a marked resemblance to his uncle, the great emperor. He was
on good terms with Jerome, who for some time made him a large
allowance, and father and son occasionally met. His elder son,
also called Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte (1832-1893), entered the
French army, with which he served in the Crimea and in Italy.</p>

<p>Charles Joseph Bonaparte (b. 1851), younger son of the first
Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte, and a grandson of Jerome, king
of Westphalia, attained a distinguished place in American
politics. Born at Baltimore on the 9th of June 1851 and
educated at Harvard University, he became a lawyer in 1874 and
has been president of the National Municipal League and has
filled other public positions. He was secretary of the navy in
President Roosevelt&rsquo;s cabinet from July 1905 to December 1906,
and then attorney-general of the United States until March 1909.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONAR, HORATIUS<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> (1808-1889), Scottish Presbyterian
divine, was born in Edinburgh on the 19th of December 1808,
and educated at the high school and university of his native city.
After a term of mission work at Leith, he was appointed parish
minister of Kelso in 1837, and at the Disruption of 1843 became
minister of the newly formed Free Church, where he remained
till 1866, when he went to the Chalmers memorial church,
Edinburgh. He had in 1853 received the D.D. degree from Aberdeen
University, and in 1883 he was moderator of the general assembly
of his church. He died on the 31st of July 1889. Bonar was a
prolific writer of religious literature, and edited several journals,
including the <i>Christian Treasury</i>, the <i>Presbyterian Review</i>
and the <i>Quarterly Journal of Prophecy</i>; but his best work was
done in hymnology, and he published three series of <i>Hymns of Faith
and Hope</i> between 1857 and 1866 (new ed., 1886). Nearly every
modern hymnal contains perhaps a score of his hymns, including
&ldquo;Go, labour on,&rdquo; &ldquo;I heard the voice of Jesus say,&rdquo; &ldquo;Here, O my
Lord, I see Thee face to face,&rdquo; &ldquo;When the weary, seeking rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONAVENTURA, SAINT<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> (<span class="sc">John of Fidanza</span>), Franciscan theologian,
was born in 1221 at Bagnarea in Tuscany. He was destined
by his mother for the church, and is said to have received
his cognomen of Bonaventura from St Francis of Assisi, who
performed on him a miraculous cure. He entered the Franciscan
order in 1243, and studied at Paris possibly under Alexander
of Hales, and certainly under Alexander&rsquo;s successor, John of
Rochelle, to whose chair he succeeded in 1253. Three years
earlier his fame had gained for him permission to read upon the
<i>Sentences</i>, and in 1255 he received the degree of doctor. So
high was his reputation that in the following year he was elected
general of his order. It was by his orders that Roger Bacon was
interdicted from lecturing at Oxford, and compelled to put
himself under the surveillance of the order at Paris. He was
instrumental in procuring the election of Gregory X., who
rewarded him with the titles of cardinal and bishop of Albano,
and insisted on his presence at the great council of Lyons in
the year 1274. At this meeting he died.</p>

<p>Bonaventura&rsquo;s character seems not unworthy of the eulogistic
title, &ldquo;Doctor Seraphicus,&rdquo; bestowed on him by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span>
contemporaries, and of the place assigned to him by Dante in his
<i>Paradiso</i>. He was formally canonized in 1482 by Sixtus IV.,
and ranked as sixth among the great doctors of the church by
Sixtus V. in 1587. His works, as arranged in the Lyons edition
(7 vols., folio), consist of expositions and sermons, filling the
first three volumes; of a commentary on the <i>Sentences</i> of
Lombardus, in two volumes, celebrated among medieval theologians
as incomparably the best exposition of the third part;
and of minor treatises filling the remaining two volumes, and
including a life of St Francis. The smaller works are the most
important, and of them the best are the famous <i>Itinerarium
Mentis ad Deum, Breviloquium, De Reductione Artium ad Theologiam,
Soliloquium</i>, and <i>De septem itineribus aeternitatis</i>, in which
most of what is individual in his teaching is contained.</p>

<p>In philosophy Bonaventura presents a marked contrast to
his great contemporaries, Thomas Aquinas and Roger Bacon.
While these may be taken as representing respectively physical
science yet in its infancy, and Aristotelian scholasticism in its
most perfect form, he brings before us the mystical and Platonizing
mode of speculation which had already to some extent found
expression in Hugo and Richard of St Victor, and in Bernard
of Clairvaux. To him the purely intellectual element, though
never absent, is of inferior interest when compared with the
living power of the affections or the heart. He rejects the
authority of Aristotle, to whose influence he ascribes much of the
heretical tendency of the age, and some of whose cardinal
doctrines&mdash;such as the eternity of the world&mdash;he combats
vigorously. But the Platonism he received was Plato as understood
by St Augustine, and as he had been handed down by the
Alexandrian school and the author of the mystical works passing
under the name of Dionysius the Areopagite. Bonaventura
accepts as Platonic the theory that ideas do not exist <i>in rerum
natura</i>, but as thoughts of the divine mind, according to which
actual things were formed; and this conception has no slight
influence upon his philosophy. Like all the great scholastic
doctors he starts with the discussion of the relations between
reason and faith. All the sciences are but the handmaids of
theology; reason can discover some of the moral truths which
form the groundwork of the Christian system, but others it can
only receive and apprehend through divine illumination. In
order to obtain this illumination the soul must employ the
proper means, which are prayer, the exercise of the virtues,
whereby it is rendered fit to accept the divine light, and meditation
which may rise even to ecstatic union with God. The
supreme end of life is such union, union in contemplation or
intellect and in intense absorbing love; but it cannot be entirely
reached in this life, and remains as a hope for futurity. The
mind in contemplating God has three distinct aspects, stages or
grades&mdash;the senses, giving empirical knowledge of what is
without and discerning the traces (<i>vestigia</i>) of the divine in the
world; the reason, which examines the soul itself, the image
of the divine Being; and lastly, pure intellect (<i>intelligentia</i>),
which, in a transcendent act, grasps the Being of the divine cause.
To these three correspond the three kinds of theology&mdash;<i>theologia
symbolica, theologia propria</i> and <i>theologia mystica</i>. Each stage
is subdivided, for in contemplating the outer world we may use
the senses or the imagination; we may rise to a knowledge of
God <i>per vestigia</i> or <i>in vestigiis</i>. In the first case the three great
properties of physical bodies&mdash;weight, number, measure,&mdash;in
the second the division of created things into the classes of
those that have merely physical existence, those that have life,
and those that have thought, irresistibly lead us to conclude the
power, wisdom and goodness of the Triune God. So in the
second stage we may ascend to the knowledge of God, <i>per
imaginem</i>, by reason, or <i>in imagine</i>, by the pure understanding
(<i>intellectus</i>); in the one case the triple division&mdash;memory,
understanding and will,&mdash;in the other the Christian virtues&mdash;faith,
hope and charity,&mdash;leading again to the conception of a
Trinity of divine qualities&mdash;eternity, truth and goodness. In
the last stage we have first <i>intelligentia</i>, pure intellect, contemplating
the essential being of God, and finding itself compelled
by necessity of thought to hold absolute being as the first notion,
for non-being cannot be conceived apart from being, of which it
is but the privation. To this notion of absolute being, which is
perfect and the greatest of all, objective existence must be
ascribed. In its last and highest form of activity the mind rests
in the contemplation of the infinite goodness of God, which is
apprehended by means of the highest faculty, the <i>apex mentis</i> or
<i>synderesis</i>. This spark of the divine illumination is common to
all forms of mysticism, but Bonaventura adds to it peculiarly
Christian elements. The complete yielding up of mind and heart
to God is unattainable without divine grace, and nothing renders
us so fit to receive this gift as the meditative and ascetic life of
the cloister. The monastic life is the best means of grace.</p>

<p>Bonaventura, however, is not merely a meditative thinker,
whose works may form good manuals of devotion; he is a
dogmatic theologian of high rank, and on all the disputed
questions of scholastic thought, such as universals, matter,
the principle of individualism, or the <i>intellectus agens</i>, he gives
weighty and well-reasoned decisions. He agrees with Albertus
Magnus in regarding theology as a practical science; its truths,
according to his view, are peculiarly adapted to influence the
affections. He discusses very carefully the nature and meaning
of the divine attributes; considers universals to be the ideal
forms pre-existing in the divine mind according to which things
were shaped; holds matter to be pure potentiality which
receives individual being and determinateness from the formative
power of God, acting according to the ideas; and finally maintains
that the <i>intellectus agens</i> has no separate existence. On these
and on many other points of scholastic philosophy the Seraphic
Doctor exhibits a combination of subtilty and moderation which
makes his works peculiarly valuable.</p>

He gained his first military experience in the American War of
Independence, and on his return to France was made a captain
of grenadiers in the French army. He was a staunch upholder
of the monarchy, and at the outbreak of the French Revolution
resigned his command and retired to his château at St Florent.
In the spring of 1793 he was chosen leader by the insurgents of
the Vendée, and to his counsels may be attributed in great
measure the success of the peasants&rsquo; arms. He was present at
the taking of Bressuire, Thouars and Fontenay, at which last
place he was wounded; but dissensions among their leaders
weakened the insurgents, and at the bloody battle of Cholet
(October 1793) the Vendéans sustained a severe defeat and
Bonchamps was mortally wounded. He died the next day. It

was born at Hanwell on the 31st of December 1815,
the son of a schoolmaster. He was educated at Merchant Taylors&rsquo;
school, and in 1832 obtained a post in the public record
office. In 1838 he became an assistant in the manuscript
department of the British Museum, where he attracted the
notice of his chief, Sir Frederick Madden, the most eminent
palaeographer of his day, and in 1852 he was made Egerton
librarian. In 1856 he became assistant keeper of MSS., and in
1867 was promoted to the post of keeper. His work in
reorganizing the manuscript department was of lasting value,
and to him is due the classified catalogue of MSS., and the
improved efficiency and punctuality of publication of the
department. In 1878 he was appointed principal librarian.
Under his supervision were erected the new buildings of the

an exact science. He was made LL.D. of Cambridge in 1879,
created C.B. in 1885, and K.C.B. the day before his death on

<p>Recitals are frequently added to explain the circumstances
under which the bond is given.</p>

<p>If the condition is not performed, <i>i.e</i>. if the obligor does not
pay the money by the day stipulated, or do or refrain from
doing the act provided for, the bond becomes forfeit or absolute
at law, and charges the obligor and his estate (see Conveyancing
Act 1881, s. 59). In old days, when a bond was forfeit, the whole
penalty was recoverable at law and payment <i>post diem</i> could not
be pleaded to an action on it, but the court of chancery early
interposed to prevent oppression. It held the penalty of a bond
to be the form, not the substance of it, a pledge merely to secure
repayment of the sum bona fide advanced, and would not permit
a man to take more than in conscience he ought, <i>i.e</i>. in case of
a common money bond, his principal, interest and expenses.
This equitable relief received statutory recognition by an act of
1705, which provided that, in case of a common money bond,
payment of the lesser sum with interest and costs shall be taken
in full satisfaction of the bond. An obligee of a common money
bond can, since the date of the Judicature Act, obtain summary
judgment under O. xiv. (R.S.C. 1883) by specially endorsing
his writ under O. iii. R. 6.</p>

<p>Bonds were, however, and still are given to secure performance
of a variety of matters other than the payment of a sum of money
at a fixed date. They may be given and are given, for instance,
to guarantee the fidelity of a clerk, of a rent collector, or of a
person in an office of public trust, or to secure that an intended
husband will settle a sum on his wife in the event of her surviving
him, or that a building contract shall be carried out, or that a
rival business shall not be carried on by the obligor except
within certain limits of time and space. The same object can
often be attained&mdash;and more conveniently attained&mdash;by a
covenant than by bond, and covenants have in the practice of
conveyancers largely superseded bonds, but there are cases
where security by bond is still preferable to security by covenant.
Thus under a bond to secure an annuity, if the obligor makes
default, judgment may be entered for the penalty and stand as
security for the future payments without the necessity of
bringing a fresh action for each payment. In cases of bonds
with special conditions, such as those instanced above, the
remedy of the obligee for breach of the condition is prescribed
by an act of 1696, the procedure under which is preserved by the
Judicature Act (O. xxii. R. 1, O. xiii. R. 14). The obligee
assigns the particular breaches of which he complains, damages
in respect of such breaches are assessed, and, on payment into
court by the obligor of the amount of such damages, the court
enters a stay of execution. A difficulty which has much exercised
and still exercises the courts is to determine, in these cases of
special conditions, whether the sum for which the bond is given
is a true penalty or only liquidated damages. There is nothing
to prevent the parties to a bond from agreeing the damages for
a breach, and if they have done so, the court will not interfere,
as it will in the case of a penalty. The leading case on the
subject is <i>Kemble</i> v. <i>Farren</i> (1829; 6 Bing. 148).</p>

<p>Bonds given to secure the doing of anything which is contrary
to the policy of the law are void. Such, for instance, is a bond
given to a woman for future cohabitation (as distinguished from
past cohabitation), or a marriage brocage bond, that is, a bond
given to procure a marriage between parties. (See the matrimonial
agency case, <i>Hermann</i> v. <i>Charlesworth</i>, 1905, 2 K.B. 123).
It was not without design that Shakespeare laid the scene of
Shylock&rsquo;s suit on Antonio&rsquo;s bond in a Venetian court; the bond
would have had short shrift in an English court.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Post Obit Bonds</i>.&mdash;A post obit bond is one given by an expectant
heir or legatee, payable on or after the death of the person from
whom the obligor has expectations. Such a bond, if the obligee has
exacted unconscionable terms, may be set aside.</p>

<p><i>Bottomry Bonds</i>.&mdash;A bottomry bond is a contract of hypothecation
by which the owner of a ship, or the master as his agent, borrows
money for the use of the ship to meet some emergency, <i>e.g.</i> necessary
repairs, and pledges the ship (or keel or bottom of the ship, <i>partem
pro toto</i>) as security for repayment. If the ship safely accomplishes
her voyage, the obligee gets his money back with the agreed interest:
if the ship is totally lost, he loses it altogether.</p>

<p><i>Lloyd&rsquo;s Bonds</i>.&mdash;Lloyd&rsquo;s bonds are instruments under the seal of a
railway company, admitting the indebtedness of the company to
the obligee to a specified amount for work done or goods supplied,
with a covenant to pay him such amount with interest on a future
day. They are a device by which railway companies were enabled
to increase their indebtedness without technically violating their
charter. The name is derived from the counsel who settled the form
of the bond.</p>

<p><i>Debenture Bonds</i>.&mdash;Debenture bonds are bonds secured only by
the covenant of the company without any floating or fixed charge on
the assets. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Debentures and Debenture Stock</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Recognizance</i>.&mdash;A recognizance differs from a bond in being
entered into before a court of record and thereby becoming an
obligation of record.</p>

<p><i>Heritable bond</i> is a Scots law term, meaning a bond for money,
joined with a conveyance of land, and held by a creditor as security
for his debt.</p>

<p><a name="ft1j" id="ft1j" href="#fa1j"><span class="fn">1</span></a> This word, meaning &ldquo;that which binds,&rdquo; is a phonetic variant
of &ldquo;band,&rdquo; and is derived from the Teutonic root seen in <i>bindan</i>,
to bind; it must be distinguished from the obsolete &ldquo;bond,&rdquo;
meaning originally a householder. In the laws of Canute this word
is used as equal to the Old English <i>ceorl</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Churl</a></span>), and thus, as
the churl&rsquo;s position became less free after the Norman Conquest, the
&ldquo;bond&rdquo; approximated to the &ldquo;villein,&rdquo; and still later to the &ldquo;serf.&rdquo;
The word is in Old English <i>bonda</i>, and appears in &ldquo;husband&rdquo; (<i>q.v</i>.),
and is derived from the root of the verb <i>búa</i>, to dwell, to have a
house, the Latin <i>colere</i>, and thus in origin is cognate with German
<i>Bauer</i> and English &ldquo;boor.&rdquo; The transition in meaning to the idea
of serfdom, and hence to slavery, is due to an early confusion with
&ldquo;bond,&rdquo; from &ldquo;bind.&rdquo; The same wrong connexion appears in the
transition of meaning in &ldquo;bondage,&rdquo; properly &ldquo;tenure in villeinage,&rdquo;
but now used as synonymous with &ldquo;slavery.&rdquo; A trace of the
early meaning still survives in &ldquo;bondager&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONDE, GUSTAF,<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> <span class="sc">Count</span> (1620-1667), Swedish statesman.
He is remarkable for being the persistent advocate of a pacific
policy at a time when war on the slightest provocation was the
watchword of every Swedish politician. Even the popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>200</span>
Polish adventure of Charles X. was strenuously opposed by
Bonde, though when once it was decided upon he materially
assisted the king to find the means for carrying it on. He was
also in favour of strict economy coupled with the recovery of the
royal domains which had fallen into the hands of the nobles,
though his natural partiality for his fellow-peers came out clearly
enough when in 1655 he was appointed a member of Charles X.&rsquo;s
land-recovery commission. In 1659 he succeeded Herman
Fleming as lord high treasurer, and was one of the council of
regency appointed to govern Sweden during the minority of
Charles XI. In 1661 he presented to the senate a plan which
aimed at rendering Sweden altogether independent of foreign
subsidies, by a policy of peace, economy and trade-development,
and by further recovery of alienated estates. His budget in
the following year, framed on the same principles, subsequently
served as an invaluable guide to Charles XI. Bonde&rsquo;s extraordinary
tenacity of purpose enabled him for some years to carry
out his programme, despite the opposition of the majority of
the senate and his co-regents, who preferred the more adventurous
methods of the chancellor Magnus de la Gardie, ultimately
so ruinous to Sweden. But the ambition of the oligarchs, and
the fear and jealousy of innumerable monopolists who rose in
arms against his policy of economy, proved at last too strong
for Bonde, while the costly and useless expedition against
Bremen in 1665, undertaken contrary to his advice, completed
the ruin of the finances. In his later years Bonde&rsquo;s powers of
resistance were weakened by sickness and mortification at the
triumph of reckless extravagance, and he practically retired
from the government some time before his death.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONDED WAREHOUSE,<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span> a warehouse established by the
state, or by private enterprise, in which goods liable to duty
are lodged until the duty upon them has been paid. Previous
to the establishment of bonded warehouses in England the payment
of duties on imported goods had to be made at the time
of importation, or a bond with security for future payment
given to the revenue authorities. The inconveniences of this
system were many; it was not always possible for the importer
to find sureties, and he had often to make an immediate sale of
the goods, in order to raise the duty, frequently selling when
the market was depressed and prices low; the duty, having to
be paid in a lump sum, raised the price of the goods by the
amount of the interest on the capital required to pay the duty;
competition was stifled from the fact that large capital was
required for the importation of the more heavily taxed articles;
there was also the difficulty of granting an exact equivalent
drawback to the exporter, on goods which had already paid
duty. To obviate these difficulties and to put a check upon
frauds on the revenue, Sir Robert Walpole proposed in his
&ldquo;excise scheme&rdquo; of 1733, the system of warehousing, so far as
concerned tobacco and wine. The proposal, however, was very
unpopular, and it was not till 1803 that the system was actually
adopted. By an act of that year imported goods were to be
placed in warehouses approved by the customs authorities, and
importers were to give &ldquo;bonds&rdquo; for payment of duties when
the goods were removed. It was from this that the warehouses
received the name of &ldquo;bonded&rdquo; or &ldquo;bonding.&rdquo; The Customs
Consolidation Act 1853 dispensed with the giving of bonds, and
laid down various provisions for securing the payment of customs
duties on goods warehoused. These provisions are contained in
the Customs Consolidation Act 1876, and the amending statutes,
the Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1880, and the Revenue
Act 1883. The warehouses are known as &ldquo;king&rsquo;s warehouses,&rdquo;
and by s. 284 of the act of 1876 are defined as &ldquo;any place provided
by the crown or approved by the commissioners of
customs, for the deposit of goods for security thereof, and the
duties due thereon.&rdquo; By s. 12 of the same act the treasury may
appoint warehousing ports or places, and the commissioners
of customs may from time to time approve and appoint warehouses
in such ports or places where goods may be warehoused
or kept, and fix the amount of rent payable in respect of the
goods. The proprietor or occupier of every warehouse so approved
(except existing warehouses of special security in respect
of which security by bond has hitherto been dispensed with),
or some one on his behalf, must, before any goods be warehoused
therein, give security by bond, or such other security as the
commissioners may approve of, for the payment of the full
duties chargeable on any goods warehoused therein, or for the
due exportation thereof (s. 13). All goods deposited in a
warehouse, without payment of duty on the first importation, upon
being entered for home consumption, are chargeable with
existing duties on like goods under any customs acts in force
at the time of passing such entry (s. 19). The act also prescribes
various rules for the unshipping, landing, examination,
warehousing and custody of goods, and the penalties on breach.
The system of warehousing has proved of great advantage both
to importers and purchasers, as the payment of duty is deferred
until the goods are required, while the title-deeds, or warrants,
are transferable by endorsement.</p>

<p>While the goods are in the warehouse (&ldquo;in bond&rdquo;) the owner
may subject them to various processes necessary to fit them
for the market, such as the repacking and mixing of tea, the
racking, vatting, mixing and bottling of wines and spirits, the
roasting of coffee, the manufacture of certain kinds of tobacco,
&amp;c., and certain specific allowances are made in respect of waste
arising from such processes or from leakage, evaporation and
the like.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONDU,<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span> a French protectorate in West Africa, dependent on
the colony of Senegal. Bondu lies between the Faleme river
and the upper course of the Gambia, that is between 13° and
15° N., and 12° and 13° W. The country is an elevated plateau,
with hills in the southern and central parts. These are generally
unproductive, and covered with stunted wood; but the lower
country is fertile, and finely clothed with the baobab, the
tamarind and various valuable fruit-trees. Bondu is traversed
by torrents, which flow rapidly during the rains but are empty
in the dry season, such streams being known in this part of West
Africa as <i>marigots</i>. The inhabitants are mostly Fula, though
the trade is largely in the hands of Mandingos. The religion and
laws of the country are Mahommedan, though the precepts of
that faith are not very rigorously observed. Mungo Park, the
first European traveller to visit the country, passed through
Bondu in 1795, and had to submit to many exactions from the
reigning prince. The royal residence was then at Fatteconda;
but when Major W. Gray, a British officer who attempted to
solve the Niger problem, visited Bondu in 1818 it had been
removed to Bulibani, a small town, with about 3000 population,
surrounded by a strong clay wall. In August 1845 the king of
Bondu signed a treaty recognizing French sovereignty over his
country. The treaty was disregarded by the natives, but in
1858 Bondu came definitely under French control. The country
has since enjoyed considerable prosperity (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Senegal</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONE, HENRY<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> (1755-1834), English enamel painter, was born
at Truro. He was much employed by London jewellers for small
designs in enamel, before his merits as an artist were well known
to the public. In 1800 the beauty of his pieces attracted the
notice of the Royal Academy, of which he was then admitted
as an associate; in 1811 he was made an academician. Up to
1831 he executed many beautiful miniature pieces of much
larger size than had been attempted before in England; among
these his eighty-five portraits of the time of Queen Elizabeth,
of different sizes, from 5 by 4 to 13 by 8 in. are most admired.
They were disposed of by public sale after his death. His
Bacchus and Ariadne, after Titian, painted on a plate, brought
the great price of 2200 guineas.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bone Diseases and Injuries</span>.&mdash;The more specific diseases
affecting the bones of the human body are treated under separate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>201</span>
headings; in this article <i>inflammation of bone</i> and <i>fractures</i> are
dealt with.</p>

<p><i>Ostitis</i> (<span class="grk" title="osteon">&#8000;&#963;&#964;&#941;&#959;&#957;</span>, bone), or inflammation of bone, may be acute
or chronic. <i>Acute ostitis</i> is one of the most serious diseases which
can be met with in young people. It is due to the
cultivation of virulent germs in the delicate growing
<span class="sidenote">Ostitis.</span>
tissue of the bone and in the marrow. Another name for it is
<i>septic osteomyelitis</i>, which has the advantage of expressing the
cause as well as the exact seat (<span class="grk" title="myelos">&#956;&#965;&#949;&#955;&#972;&#962;</span>, marrow) of the inflammation.
The name of the micro-organism causing the inflammation
is <i>Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus</i>, which means that the
germs collect in clusters like grapes, that they are of the virulent
pus-producing kind, and that they have a yellow tinge. As a
rule, the germs find their way to the bone by the blood-stream,
which they have entered through the membrane lining the
mouth or gullet, or some other part of the alimentary canal. In
the pre-antiseptic days they often entered the sawn bone during
the amputation of a limb, and were not infrequently the cause
of blood-poisoning and death. When the individual is well and
strong, and there has been no hurt, strain or accident to lower
the power of resistance of the bone, the staphylococci may
circulate harmlessly in the blood, until they are gradually eaten
up by the white corpuscles; but if a bone has been injured it
offers a likely and attractive focus to the wandering germs.</p>

<p>The disease is infective. That is to say, the micro-organisms
having begun to germinate in the damaged bone find their way
by the blood-stream into other tissues, and developing after their
kind, are apt to cause blood-poisoning. Should a surgeon prick
his finger whilst operating on a case of septic osteomyelitis his
blood also might be poisoned, and he would run the risk of losing
his finger, his hand, or even his life. The starting-point of the
disease is the delicate growing tissue recently deposited between
the main part of the shaft of the bone (diaphysis) and the cartilaginous
end. And it often happens that the earliest complaint
of pain is just above or below the knee; just above the ankle,
the elbow or the wrist. <span class="correction" title="amended from It">If</span> the surgeon is prompt in operating
he may find the disease limited to that spot. In the case of
infants, the germs are very apt to make their way into the
neighbouring joint, giving rise to the very serious disease known
as <i>acute arthritis of infants</i>.</p>

<p>Probably the first sign of there being anything amiss with the
limb will be a complaint of aches or pains near a joint; and
these pains are apt to be miscalled rheumatic. Perhaps they
occur during convalescence from scarlet or typhoid fever, or after
exposure to injury, or to wet or cold, or after unusual fatigue.
The part becomes swollen, hot, red and excessively tender; the
tenderness, however, is not in the skin but in the bone, and in
the engorged membrane around it, the periosteum. The temperature
may run up to 104°, and may be associated with convulsions
or shiverings. The patient&rsquo;s nights are disturbed, and
very likely he has violent delirium. If the case is allowed
to drift on, abscess forms, and death may ensue from septic
pneumonia, or pericarditis, or from some other form of blood-poisoning.</p>

<p>As soon as the disease is recognized an incision should be made
down to the bone, and the affected area should be scraped out, and
disinfected with a solution of corrosive sublimate. A considerable
area of the bone may be found stripped bare by sub-periosteal
abscess, and necrosis is likely to ensue. Perhaps the shaft of
the bone will have to be opened up in the chief part of its length
in order that it may be cleared of germs and pus. The surgeon is
more apt to err on the side of doing too little in these serious
cases than too much. It may be that the whole of that piece of
bone (diaphysis) which lies between the joint-ends is found loose
in a large abscess cavity, and in some cases immediate amputation
of the limb may be found necessary in order to save life; in
other cases, amputation may be called for later because of long-continued
suppuration and grave constitutional disturbance.
Several bones may be affected at the same time, and large pieces
of them may be killed outright (<i>multiple necrosis</i>) by inflammatory
engorgement and devastating abscess.</p>

<p>Septic ostitis may be confounded with erysipelas and rheumatism,
but the central thickening and tenderness should suffice to
distinguish it.</p>

<p><i>Chronic ostitis</i> and <i>periostitis</i> denote long-continued and
increased vascular supply. This may be due to injury, syphilis or
rheumatism. The disease is found chiefly in the shafts of the
bones. There is a dull pain in the bone, which is worse at night,
and the inflamed piece of bone is thickened and tender. The
lump thus formed is called a <i>hard node</i>, and its outline shows
clearly by X-rays. The affected limb should be rested and kept
elevated. Leeches and fomentations may ease the pain, and
iodide of potassium is the most useful medicine.</p>

<p><i>Chronic inflammation of tuberculous origin</i> affects the soft,
cancellated tissue of such bones as the vertebrae, and the bones
of the hands and feet, as well as the spongy ends of the long bones.
In tuberculous ostitis the presence of the bacilli in the spongy
tissue causes an escape of colourless corpuscles from the blood,
which, collecting around the bacilli, form a small greyish white
heap, a <i>tubercle</i>. These tubercles may be present in large numbers
at the expense of the living tissue, and a <i>rarefying ostitis</i> is thus
produced. Later the tubercles break down and form tuberculous
abscesses, which slowly, and almost painlessly, find escape upon
the surface. They should not be allowed to open spontaneously,
however, as the wounds are then likely to become infected with
pus-producing germs, and fuel being added to the fire, as it were,
destruction advances with increased rapidity. The treatment
for these tuberculous foci is to place the limb or the part at
absolute rest upon a splint, to give plenty of fresh air to the
patient, and to prescribe cod-liver oil and iron. And when it is
seen that in spite of the adoption of these measures the tuberculous
abscess is advancing towards the surface, the surgeon should
cut down upon the part, scrape out the foci, and disinfect with
some strong antiseptic lotion. Consideration should also be
given to the treatment by injection of tuberculin.</p>

<p><i>Caries</i> (rottenness, decay) is the name given to tuberculous
disease of bone when the tubercles are running together and are
breaking down the cancellous tissue. In short, caries generally
means tuberculous ostitis, though syphilitic ulceration of bone
has also received the same name.</p>

<p><i>Fractures</i>.&mdash;A bone may be broken at the part where it is
struck (fracture from direct violence), or it may break in consequence
of a strain applied to it (fracture from indirect
violence), or the fracture may be due to muscular action
<span class="sidenote">Fracture.</span>
as when a violent cough causes a rib to break. In the first case
the fracture is generally transverse and in the second more or less
oblique. The fully developed bone is broken fairly across; the
soft bones of young people may simply be bent&mdash;<i>green stick</i> or
<i>willow fracture</i>. Fractures are either <i>simple</i> or <i>compound</i>. A
simple fracture is analogous to the subcutaneous laceration in the
soft parts, and a compound one to an open wound in the soft
parts. The wound of the soft parts in the compound fracture may
be due either to the force which caused the fracture, as in the case
of a cart-wheel going over a limb, first wounding the soft parts and
then fracturing the bone, or to the sharp point of the fractured
bone coming out through the skin. In either case there is a communication
between the external air and injured bone, and the
probability arises of the germs of suppuration finding their way
to the seat of fracture. This greatly increases the risks of the
case, for septic inflammation and suppuration may lead to delayed
union, to death of large pieces of the bone (necrosis), and to osteomyelitis
and to blood-poisoning. In the treatment of a fracture,
every care should be taken to prevent any sharp fragment coming
near the skin. Careless handling has often been the means of a
simple fracture being converted into a compound one.</p>

<p>In most cases of fracture <i>crepitus</i> can be made out; this is the
feeling elicited when two rough osseous surfaces are rubbed
together. When a bone is merely bent there is, of course, no
crepitus. It is also absent in fractures in which the broken
extremities are driven into one another (impacted fracture).
In order to get firm bony union it is necessary to secure accurate
apposition of the fragments. Putting the broken ends together
is termed &ldquo;setting the fracture,&rdquo; and the needful amount of rest
is obtained by the use of splints. As a rule, it is also advisable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span>
fix with the splint the joint above or below the fracture. In
cases in which a splintering of the bone into a joint has taken
place, more especially in those cases in which tendons have been
injured, there may be a good deal of effusion into the joint and
the tendon sheaths, and this may be organized into fibrous
tissue leading to permanent stiffness. This is particularly apt to
occur in old people. Care must be taken in such instances by
gentle exercises, and by passive movement during the process of
cure, to keep the joint and tendons free. To take a common
example,&mdash;in fracture close to the wrist joint, it is necessary to
arrange the splint so that the patient can move his fingers and
thumb, and the splint must be taken off every day, in order
that the wrist and fingers may be gently bent, straightened and
exercised.</p>

<p>The treatment of fractures has undergone considerable improvement
of late years. Simple fractures are not kept so long
at rest in splints, but are constantly &ldquo;taken down&rdquo; in order
that massage and movements of the limb may be resorted to.
This, of course, is done with the utmost gentleness, and with the
result that swelling, pain and other evidences of the serious
injury quickly disappear, whilst a more rapid and complete
recovery is ensured. Stiff hands and feet after fracture are much
less frequently met with. By the aid of the X-rays it is now easy
for the surgeon to assure himself that fractured surfaces have been
well adjusted and are in close apposition. But if they are not in
a satisfactory position, and it be found impracticable to assure
their close adjustment by ordinary methods, the surgeon now,
without undue loss of time, cuts down upon the broken ends and
fixes them together by a strong wire suture, which remains
permanently in the tissues. If the fracture be associated with an
open wound of the part (compound fracture), and the broken
ends are found incapable of easy adjustment, immediate wiring
together of the fragments is now considered to be a necessary
part of the primary treatment. The French surgeon, Just
Lucas-Championnière, has done more than any one else to show
the advantage of discreet movements, of massage and of exercises
in the treatment of fractures.</p>

<p><i>Special Fracture in Young People</i>.&mdash;The long bones of children
and growing persons consist of a shaft with cartilaginous ends
in which bone is developed. As the result of injury, the end of
the bone may become detached, a variety of fracture known as
<i>diastasis</i>. Such a fracture&mdash;however well treated&mdash;may be
followed by arrest of growth of the bone or by stiffness of the
neighbouring joint.</p>

<p><i>Delayed union</i> means that consolidation is taking place very
slowly, if at all. This may be due to local or constitutional
causes, but provided the bones are in good position, nothing
further than patience, with massage, and with due attention
to general health-measures, is necessary.</p>

<p>An <i>ununited fracture</i> is one in which after many weeks or
months no attempt has been made by nature to consolidate the
parts. This may be due to the ends not having been brought
close enough together; to the seat of fracture having been
constantly disturbed; to muscle or tendon being interposed
between the broken ends, or to the existence of some constitutional
defect in the patient. Except in the last-named
condition, the treatment consists in cutting down to the broken
ends; freshening them up by sawing off a thin slice, and by
adjusting and fixing them by a wire or screw. Ununited
fracture of the leg-bones in children is a most unsatisfactory
and rebellious condition to deal with.</p>

<p>There is still a difference of opinion as to the best way of
treating a recent <i>fracture of the patella</i> (knee-cap). Many surgeons
are still content to follow the old plan of fixing the limb on a
back-splint, or in plaster of Paris splints, and awaiting the result.
It is beyond question that a large percentage of these cases
recover with a perfectly useful limb&mdash;especially if the fibrous
bond of union between the pieces of the broken knee-cap is
adequately protected against being stretched by bending the
leg at too early a date. But in some cases the fragments have
been eventually found wide apart, the patient being left with
an enfeebled limb. Still, at any rate, this line of treatment was
unassociated with risk. But after Lister showed (1883) that
with due care and cleanliness the knee-joint could be opened,
and the fragments of the broken patella secured in close
apposition by a stout wire suture, the treatment of the injury
underwent a remarkable change. The great advantage of Lister&rsquo;s
treatment was that the fragments, being fixed close together
by the wire stitch, became solidly united by bone, and the joint
became as sound as it was before. Some surgeons, however,
objected to the operation&mdash;in spite of the excellence of the
results obtainable by it&mdash;because of the undoubted risk which
it entailed of the joint becoming invaded by septic micro-organisms.
As a sort of compromise, Professor A.E.J. Barker
introduced the method, which he deemed to be less hazardous,
of holding the fragments close together by means of a strong
silver wire passed round them vertically by a large needle without
actually laying open the joint. But experience has shown that
in the hands of careful and skilful surgeons Lister&rsquo;s operation
of openly wiring the fragments gives a perfect result with a
comparatively small risk. Other surgeons secure the fragments
in close contact for bony union by passing a silk or metal suture
around them circumferentially. Many years ago Lister remarked
that the careful selection of one&rsquo;s patients is an antiseptic
measure&mdash;by which he meant that if a surgeon intended to get
the most perfect results for his operative work, he must carefully
consider whether any individual patient is physically adapted
for the performance upon him of any particular operation. This
aphorism implies that not every patient with a broken knee-cap
is suited for the opening of his knee-joint, or even for the subcutaneous
adjustment of the broken fragments. An operative
procedure which is admirably suited for one patient might
result in disaster when adopted for another, and it is an important
part of the surgeon&rsquo;s business to know what to advise in each
individual case.</p>

<p><i>Industrial Applications of Bones</i>.&mdash;By the increasing inventiveness
of man, the industrial utilization of animal bone has been so developed
that not one of the constituents fails to reappear in commerce.
Composed of mineral matter&mdash;phosphates, &amp;c.&mdash;fat and gelatinous
substances, the phosphates are used as artificial manures, the fat is
worked up by the soap-maker and chandler, and the gelatinous
matter forms the basis of the gelatin and glue of commerce; while
by the dry distillation of bones from which the gelatin has been but
partially removed, there are obtained a carbonaceous residue&mdash;animal
charcoal&mdash;and a tarry distillate, from which &ldquo;bone oil&rdquo;
and bone pitch are obtained. To these by-products there must be
added the direct uses of bone&mdash;for making buttons, knife-handles,
&amp;c.&mdash;when an estimate is desired of the commercial importance of
these components of the animal frame.</p>

<p>While most of the world&rsquo;s supply of bones goes to the glue and
gelatin works, the leg and thigh bones, termed &ldquo;marrows&rdquo; and
&ldquo;knuckles,&rdquo; are used for the manufacture of bone articles. The
treatment which they receive is very different from that practised
in the glue-works. The ends are removed by a saw, and the bones
are steeped in a 1% brine solution for three to four days, in order
to separate the fibrous matter. The bones are now heated with
water, and allowed to simmer for about six hours. This removes a
part of the fat and gelatinous matter; the former rises as a scum,
the latter passes into solution, and the bones remain sufficiently
firm to be worked up by the lathe, &amp;c. The fat is skimmed off, and,
after bleaching, reappears as a component of fine soaps, or, if unbleached,
the oil is expressed and is used as an adulterant of other
oils, while the stearine or solid matter goes to the candle-maker;
the gelatinous water is used (after filtration) for making size for
cardboard boxes; while the bones are scrubbed, dried, and then
transferred to the bone-worker.</p>

<p>The glue-worker first removes the fat, which is supplied to the
soap and candle trades; the bones are now treated for glue (<i>q.v.</i>);
and the residue is worked up for manures, &amp;c. These residues are
ground to a fine or coarse meal, and supplied either directly as a
fertilizer or treated with sulphuric acid to form the more soluble
superphosphates, which are more readily assimilated by growing
plants. In some places, especially South America, the residues are
burned in a retort to a white ash, the &ldquo;bone-ash&rdquo; of commerce,
which contains some 70-80% of tricalcium phosphate, and is much
used as a manure, and in the manufacture of high-grade superphosphates.
In the gelatin industry (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gelatin</a></span>) the mineral
matter has to be recovered from its solution in hydrochloric acid.
To effect this, the liquors are freed from suspended matter by
filtration, and then run into vats where they are mixed with milk of
lime, or some similar neutralizer. The slightly soluble bicalcium
phosphate, CaHPO<span class="su">4</span>, is first precipitated, which, with more lime,
gives ordinary tricalcium phosphate, Ca<span class="su">3</span>(PO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">2</span>. The contents of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span>
the vats are filter-pressed, and the cakes dried on plates supported
on racks in heated chambers. This product is a very valuable
manure, and is also used in the manufacture of phosphorus.</p>

<p>Instead of extracting all the gelatinous matter from degreased
bones, the practice of extracting about one half and carbonizing
the residue is frequently adopted. The bones are heated in horizontal
cast-iron retorts, holding about 5 cwt., and the operation
occupies about twelve to thirteen hours. The residue in the retorts
is removed while still red-hot to air-tight vessels in which it is allowed
to cool. It is then passed through grinding mills, and is subsequently
riddled by revolving cylindrical sieves. The yield is from 55 to
60% of the bones carbonized, and the product contains about 10%
of carbon and about 75% of calcium phosphate, the remainder
being various inorganic salts and moisture (6-7%). Animal charcoal
has a deep black colour, and is much used as a filtering and
clarifying material. The vapours evolved during carbonization are
condensed in vertical air condensers. The liquid separates into two
layers: the upper tarry layer is floated off and redistilled; the
distillate is termed &ldquo;bone oil,&rdquo;<a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and mainly consists of many fatty
amines and pyridine derivatives, characterized by a most disgusting
odour; the residue is &ldquo;bone pitch,&rdquo; and finds application in the
manufacture of black varnishes and like compositions. The lower
layer is ammoniacal liquor; it is transferred to stills, distilled with
steam, and the ammonia received in sulphuric acid; the ammonium
sulphate, which separates, is removed, drained and dried, and is
principally used as a manure. Both during the carbonization of the
bones and the distillation of the tar inflammable gases are evolved;
these are generally used, after purification, for motive or illuminating
purposes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONE BED,<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> a term loosely used by geologists when speaking
generally of any stratum or deposit which contains bones of
whatever kind. It is also applied to those brecciated and stalagmitic
deposits on the floor of caves, which frequently contain
osseous remains. In a more restricted sense it is used to connote
certain thin layers of bony fragments, which occur upon well-defined
geological horizons. One of the best-known of these is
the Ludlow Bone Bed, which is found at the base of the Downton
Sandstone in the Upper Ludlow series. At Ludlow itself, two
such beds are actually known, separated by about 14 ft. of strata.
Although quite thin, the Ludlow Bone Bed can be followed from
that town into Gloucestershire for a distance of 45 m. It is
almost made up of fragments of spines, teeth and scales of
ganoid fish. Another well-known bed, formerly known as the
&ldquo;Bristol&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lias&rdquo; Bone Bed, exists in the form of several
thin layers of micaceous sandstone, with the remains of fish
and saurians, which occur in the Rhaetic Black Paper Shales
that lie above the Keuper marls in the south-west of England.
It is noteworthy that a similar bone bed has been traced on the
same geological horizon in Brunswick, Hanover and Franconia.
A bone bed has also been observed at the base of the Carboniferous
limestone series in certain parts of the south-west of
England.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONER<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Bonerius</span>), <span class="bold">ULRICH</span> (fl. 14th century), German-Swiss
writer of fables, was born in Bern. He was descended of
an old Bernese family, and, as far as can be ascertained, took
clerical orders and became a monk; yet as it appears that
he subsequently married, it is certain that he received the
&ldquo;tonsure&rdquo; only, and was thus entitled to the benefit of the
<i>clerici uxoriati</i>, who, on divesting themselves of the clerical garb,
could return to secular life. He is mentioned in records between
1324 and 1349, but neither before nor after these dates. He
wrote, in Middle High German, a collection of fables entitled
<i>Der Edelstein</i> (<i>c</i>. 1349), one hundred in number, which were
based principally on those of Avianus (4th century) and the
<i>Anonymus</i> (edited by I. Nevelet, 1610). This work he dedicated
to the Bernese patrician and poet, Johann von Rinkenberg,
advocatus (<i>Vogt</i>) of Brienz (d. <i>c</i>. 1350). It was printed in 1461
at Bamberg; and it is claimed for it that it was the first book
printed in the German language. Boner treats his sources with
considerable freedom and originality; he writes a clear and
simple style, and the necessarily didactic tone of the collection
is relieved by touches of humour.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BO&rsquo;NESS,<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Borrowstounness</span>, a municipal and police burgh
and seaport of Linlithgowshire, Scotland. Pop. (1891) 6295; (1901)
9306. It lies on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth, 17 m.
W. by N. of Edinburgh, and 24 m. by rail, being the terminus
of the North British railway&rsquo;s branch line from Manuel. In
the 18th century it ranked next to Leith as a port, but the growth
of Grangemouth, higher up the firth, seriously affected its shipping
trade, which is, however, yet considerable, coal and pig-iron
forming the principal exports, and pit props from the Baltic the
leading import. It has an extensive harbour (the area of the
dock being 7¾ acres). The great industries are coal-mining&mdash;some
of the pits extending for a long distance beneath the firth&mdash;iron-founding
(with several blast furnaces) and engineering, but
it has also important manufactures of salt, soap, vitriol and other
chemicals. Shipbuilding and whaling are extinct. Traces of
the wall of Antoninus which ran through the parish may still be
made out, especially near Inveravon. Blackness, on the coast
farther east, was the seaport of Linlithgow till the rise of Bo&rsquo;ness,
but its small export trade now mainly consists of coal, bricks,
tiles and lime. Its castle, standing on a promontory, is of
unknown age. James III. of Scotland is stated to have consigned
certain of the insurgent nobles to its cells; and later it was used
as a prison in which many of the Covenanters were immured.
It was one of the four castles that had to be maintained by the
Articles of Union, but when its uselessness for defensive purposes
became apparent, it was converted into an ammunition depot.
Kinneil House, 1 m. south of Bo&rsquo;ness, a seat of the duke of
Hamilton, formerly a keep, was fortified by the regent Arran,
plundered by the rebels in Queen Mary&rsquo;s reign, and reconstructed
in the time of Charles II. Dr John Roebuck (1718-1794),
founder of the Carron Iron Works, occupied it for several years
from 1764. It was here that, on his invitation, James Watt
constructed a model of his steam-engine, which was tested in a
now disused colliery. Though Roebuck lost all his money in the
coal-mines and salt works which he established at Bo&rsquo;ness, the
development of the mineral resources of the district may be
regarded as due to him.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BONFIRE<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> (in Early English &ldquo;bone-fire,&rdquo; Scottish &ldquo;bane-fire&rdquo;),
originally a fire of bones, now any large fire lit in the open air on
an occasion of rejoicing. Though the spelling &ldquo;bonfire&rdquo; was
used in the 16th century, the earlier &ldquo;bone-fire&rdquo; was common
till 1760. The earliest known instance of the derivation of the
word occurred as <i>ban fyre ignis ossium</i> in the <i>Catholicon Anglicum</i>,
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1483. Other derivations, now rejected, have been sought
for the word. Thus some have thought it <i>Baal-fire</i>, passing
through <i>Bael</i>, <i>Baen</i> to <i>Bane</i>. Others have declared it to be <i>boon</i>-fire
by analogy with <i>boen-harow</i>, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;harrowing by gift,&rdquo; the
suggestion being that these fires were &ldquo;contribution&rdquo; fires,
every one in the neighbourhood contributing a portion of the
material, just as in Northumberland the &ldquo;contributed Ploughing
Days&rdquo; are known as <i>Bone-daags</i>.</p>

<p>Whatever the origin of the word, it has long had several
meanings-(<i>a</i>) a fire of bones, (<i>b</i>) a fire for corpses, a funeral pile,
(<i>c</i>) a fire for immolation, such as that in which heretics and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span>
proscribed books were burnt, (<i>d</i>) a large fire lit in the open air,
on occasions of national rejoicing, or as a signal of alarm such
as the bonfires which warned England of the approach of the
Armada. Throughout Europe the peasants from time immemorial
have lighted bonfires on certain days of the year, and
danced around or leapt over them. This custom can be traced
back to the middle ages, and certain usages in antiquity so nearly
resemble it as to suggest that the bonfire has its origin in the
early days of heathen Europe. Indeed the earliest proof of the
observance of these bonfire ceremonies in Europe is afforded by
the attempts made by Christian synods in the 7th and 8th
centuries to suppress them as pagan. Thus the third council of
Constantinople (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 680), by its 65th canon, orders: &ldquo;Those fires
that are kindled by certaine people on new moones before their
shops and houses, over which also they use ridiculously and
foolishly to leape, by a certaine antient custome, we command
them from henceforth to cease.&rdquo; And the Synodus Francica
under Pope Zachary, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 742, forbids &ldquo;those sacrilegious fires
which they call <i>Nedfri</i> (or bonefires), and all other observations
of the Pagans whatsoever.&rdquo; Leaping over the fires is mentioned
among the superstitious rites used at the Palilia (the feast of
Pales, the shepherds&rsquo; goddess) in Ovid&rsquo;s <i>Fasti</i>, when the shepherds
lit heaps of straw and jumped over them as they burned.
The lighting of the bonfires in Christian festivals was significant
of the compromise made with the heathen by the early Church.
In Cornwall bonfires are lighted on the eve of St John the Baptist
and St Peter&rsquo;s day, and midsummer is thence called in Cornish
<i>Goluan</i>, which means both &ldquo;light&rdquo; and &ldquo;festivity.&rdquo; Sometimes
effigies are burned in these fires, or a pretence is made of
burning a living person in them, and there are grounds for believing
that anciently human sacrifices were actually made in the
bonfires. Spring and midsummer are the usual times at which
these bonfires are lighted, but in some countries they are made at
Hallowe&rsquo;en (October 31) and at Christmas. In spring the 1st
Sunday in Lent, Easter eve and the 1st of May are the commonest
dates.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONGARS, JACQUES<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> (1554-1612), French scholar and diplomatist,
was born at Orleans, and was brought up in the reformed
faith. He obtained his early education at Marburg and Jena,
and returning to France continued his studies at Orleans and
Bourges. After spending some time in Rome he visited eastern
Europe, and subsequently made the acquaintance of Ségur
Pardaillan, a representative of Henry, king of Navarre, afterwards
Henry IV. of France. He entered the service of Pardaillan,
and in 1587 was sent on a mission to many of the princes of
northern Europe, after which he visited England to obtain help
from Queen Elizabeth for Henry of Navarre. He continued
to serve Henry as a diplomatist, and in 1593 became the representative
of the French king at the courts of the imperial princes.
Vigorously seconding the efforts of Henry to curtail the power
of the house of Habsburg, he spent health and money ungrudgingly
in this service, and continued his labours until the king&rsquo;s
murder in 1610. He then returned to France, and died at
Paris on the 29th of July 1612. Bongars wrote an abridgment
of Justin&rsquo;s abridgment of the history of Trogus Pompeius under
the title <i>Justinus, Trogi Pompeii Historiarum Philippicarum
epitoma de manuscriptis codicibus emendatior et prologis auctior</i>
(Paris, 1581). He collected the works of several French writers
who as contemporaries described the crusades, and published
them under the title <i>Gesta Dei per Francos</i> (Hanover, 1611).
Another collection made by Bongars is the <i>Rerum Hungaricarum
scriptores varii</i> (Frankfort, 1600). His <i>Epistolae</i> were published
at Leiden in 1647, and a French translation at Paris in 1668-1670.
Many of his papers are preserved in the library at Bern,
to which they were presented in 1632, and a list of them was
made in 1634. Other papers and copies of instructions are now
in several libraries in Paris; and copies of other instructions
are in the British Museum.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONGHI, RUGGERO<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> (1828-1895), Italian scholar, writer
and politician, was born at Naples on the 20th of March 1828.
Exiled from Naples in consequence of the movement of 1848, he
took refuge in Tuscany, whence he was compelled to flee to
Turin on account of a pungent article against the Bourbons.
At Turin he resumed his philosophic studies and his translation
of Plato, but in 1858 refused a professorship of Greek at Pavia,
under the Austrian government, only to accept it in 1859 from
the Italian government after the liberation of Lombardy. In
1860, with the Cavour party, he opposed the work of Garibaldi,
Crispi and Bertani at Naples, and became secretary of Luigi
Carlo Farini during the latter&rsquo;s lieutenancy, but in 1865 assumed
contemporaneously the editorship of the <i>Perseveranza</i> of Milan
and the chair of Latin literature at Florence. Elected deputy
in 1860 he became celebrated by the biting wit of his speeches,
while, as journalist, the acrimony of his polemical writings made
him a redoubtable adversary. Though an ardent supporter of
the historic Right, and, as such, entrusted by the Lanza cabinet
with the defence of the law of guarantees in 1870, he was no
respecter of persons, his caustic tongue sparing neither friend nor
foe. Appointed minister for public instruction in 1873, he,
with feverish activity, reformed the Italian educational system,
suppressed the privileges of the university of Naples, founded
the Vittorio Emanuele library in Rome, and prevented the
establishment of a Catholic university in the capital. Upon the
fall of the Right from power in 1876 he joined the opposition,
and, with characteristic vivacity, protracted during two months
the debate on Baccelli&rsquo;s University Reform Bill, securing,
single-handed, its rejection. A bitter critic of King Humbert,
both in the <i>Perseveranza</i> and in the <i>Nuova Antologia</i>, he was, in
1893, excluded from court, only securing readmission shortly
before his death on the 22nd of October 1895. In foreign
policy a Francophil, he combated the Triple Alliance, and took
considerable part in the organization of the inter-parliamentary
peace conference.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONGO<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Dor</span> or <span class="sc">Deran</span>), a tribe of Nilotic negroes, probably
related to the Zandeh tribes of the Welle district, inhabiting
the south-west portion of the Bahr-el-Ghazal province, Anglo-Egyptian
Sudan. G.A. Schweinfurth, who lived two years
among them, declares that before the advent of the slave-raiders,
<i>c</i>. 1850, they numbered at least 300,000. Slave-raiders, and
later the dervishes, greatly reduced their numbers, and it was
not until the establishment of effective control by the Sudan
government (1904-1906) that recuperation was possible. The
Bongo formerly lived in countless little independent and peaceful
communities, and under the Sudan government they again
manage their own affairs. Their huts are well built, and sometimes
24 ft. high. The Bongo are a race of medium height,
inclined to be thick-set, with a red-brown complexion&mdash;&ldquo;like
the soil upon which they reside&rdquo;&mdash;and black hair. Schweinfurth
declares their heads to be nearly round, no other African race,
to his knowledge, possessing a higher cephalic index. The
women incline to steatopygia in later life, and this deposit of fat,
together with the tail of bast which they wore, gave them, as
they walked, Schweinfurth says, the appearance of &ldquo;dancing
baboons.&rdquo; The Bongo men formerly wore only a loin-cloth,
and many dozen iron rings on the arms (arranged to form a sort
of armour), while the women had simply a girdle, to which was
attached a tuft of grass. Both sexes now largely use cotton
cloths as dresses. The tribal ornaments consist of nails or plugs
which are passed through the lower lip. The women often wear
a disk several inches in diameter in this fashion, together with
a ring or a bit of straw in the upper lip, straws in the <i>alae</i> of the
nostrils, and a ring in the <i>septum</i>. The Bongo, unlike other of
the upper Nile Negroes, are not great cattle-breeders, but
employ their time in agriculture. The crops mostly cultivated
are sorghum, tobacco, sesame and durra. The Bongo eat the
fruits, tubers and fungi in which the country is rich. They also
eat almost every creature&mdash;bird, beast, insect and reptile,
with the exception of the dog. They despise no flesh, fresh or
putrid. They drive the vulture from carrion, and eat with
relish the intestinal worms of the ox. Earth-eating, too, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span>
common among them. They are particularly skilled in the
smelting and working of iron. Iron forms the currency of the
country, and is extensively employed for all kinds of useful and
ornamental purposes. Bongo spears, knives, rings, and other
articles are frequently fashioned with great artistic elaboration.
They have a variety of musical instruments&mdash;drums, stringed
instruments, and horns&mdash;in the practice of which they take
great delight; and they indulge in a vocal recitative which
seems intended to imitate a succession of natural sounds.
Schweinfurth says that Bongo music is like the raging of the
elements. Marriage is by purchase; and a man is allowed to
acquire three wives, but not more. Tattooing is partially
practised. As regards burial, the corpse is bound in a crouching
position with the knees drawn up to the chin; men are placed
in the grave with the face to the north, and women with the
face to the south. The form of the grave is peculiar, consisting
of a niche in a vertical shaft, recalling the mastaba graves of
the ancient Egyptians. The tombs are frequently ornamented
with rough wooden figures intended to represent the deceased.
Of the immortality of the soul they have no defined notion;
and their only approach to a knowledge of a beneficent deity consists
in a vague idea of luck. They have, however, a most intense
belief in a great variety of petty goblins and witches, which are
essentially malignant. Arrows, spears and clubs form their
weapons, the first two distinguished by a multiplicity of barbs.
Euphorbia juice is used as a poison for the arrows. Shields are
rare. Their language is musical, and abounds in the vowels
<i>o</i> and <i>a</i>; its vocabulary of concrete terms is very rich, but the
same word has often a great variety of meanings. The grammatical
structure is simple. As a race the Bongo are gentle and
industrious, and exhibit strong family affection.</p>

part of the state, and 70 m. N. of Dallas. Pop. (1890) 3361;
(1900) 5042 (1223 being negroes); (1910), 4844. It is served by the
Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas, and the Texas &amp; Pacific railways.
Bonham is the seat of Carlton College (Christian), a woman&rsquo;s
college founded in 1867; and its high school is one of the best
in the state. It is a trading and shipping centre of an extensive
farming territory devoted to the raising of live-stock and to the
growing of cotton, Indian corn, fruit, &amp;c. It has large cotton
gins and compresses, a large cotton mill, flour mills, canning
and ice factories, railway repair shops, planing mills and carriage
works. The town was named in honour of J.B. Bonham, a native
of South Carolina, who was killed in the Alamo. The first settlement
here was made in 1836. The town was incorporated in
1850, and was re-incorporated in 1886.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONHEUR<a name="ar101" id="ar101"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Marie Rosalie</span>], <span class="bold">ROSA</span> (1822-1899), French
painter, was born at Bordeaux on the 22nd of March 1822.
She was of Jewish origin. Jacques Wiener, the Belgian medallist,
a native of Venloo, says that he and Raymond Bonheur, Rosa&rsquo;s
father, used to attend synagogue in that town; while another
authority asserts that Rosa used to be known in common parlance
by the name of Rosa Mazeltov (a Hebrew term for &ldquo;good luck,&rdquo;
<i>Gallicé</i> Bonheur). She was the eldest of four children, all of
whom were artists&mdash;Auguste (1824-1884) painted animals and
landscape; Juliette (1830-1891) was &ldquo;honourably mentioned&rdquo;
at the exhibition of 1855; Isidore, born in 1827, was a sculptor
of animals. Rosa at an early age was taught to draw by her
father (who died in 1849), and he, perceiving her very remarkable
talent, permitted her to abandon the business of dressmaking,
to which, much against her will, she had been put, in order to
devote herself wholly to art. From 1840 to 1845 she exhibited
at the salon, and five times received a prize; in 1848 a medal
was awarded to her. Her fame dates more especially from the
exhibition of 1855; from that time Rosa Bonheur&rsquo;s works were
much sought after in England, where collectors and public
galleries competed eagerly for them. What is chiefly remarkable
and admirable in her work is that, like her contemporary,
Jacques Raymond Brascassat (1804-1867), she represents
animals as they really are, as she saw them in the country.
Her gift of accurate observation was, however, allied to a certain
dryness of style in painting; she often failed to give a perfect
sense of atmosphere. On the other hand, the anatomy of her
animals is always faultlessly true. There is nothing feminine
in her handling; her treatment is always manly and firm.
Of her many works we may note the following:&mdash;&ldquo;Ploughing
in the Nivernais&rdquo; (1848), in the Luxembourg gallery; &ldquo;The
Horse Fair&rdquo; (1853), one of the two replicas of which is in the
National Gallery, London, the original being in the United
States; and &ldquo;Hay Harvest in Auvergne&rdquo; (1835). She was
decorated with the Legion of Honour by the empress Eugénie,
and was subsequently promoted to the rank of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; of the
order. After 1867 Rosa Bonheur exhibited but once in the salon,
in 1899, a few weeks before her death. She lived quietly at her
country house at By, near Fontainebleau, where for some years
she had held gratuitous classes for drawing. She left at her
death a considerable number of pictures, studies, drawings and
etchings, which were sold by auction in Paris in the spring of
1900.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONHEUR DU JOUR,<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> the name for a lady&rsquo;s writing-desk,
so called because, when it was introduced in France about 1760,
it speedily became intensely fashionable. The bonheur du jour
is always very light and graceful; its special characteristic
is a raised back, which may form a little cabinet or a nest of
drawers, or may simply be fitted with a mirror. The top, often
surrounded with a chased and gilded bronze gallery, serves for
placing small ornaments. Beneath the writing surface there is
usually a single drawer. The details vary greatly, but the
general characteristics are always traceable. The bonheur
du jour has never been so delicate, so charming, so coquettish
as in the quarter of a century which followed its introduction.
The choicer examples of the time are inlaid with marqueterie,
edged with exotic woods, set in gilded bronze, or enriched with
panels of Oriental lacquer.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONI<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span> (<i>Boné</i>), a vassal state of the government of Celebes,
Dutch East Indies, in the south-west peninsula of Celebes, on
the Gulf of Boni. Area, 2600 sq. m. It produces rice, tobacco,
coffee, cotton and sugar-cane, none of them important as exports.
The breeds of buffaloes and horses in this state are highly
esteemed. The chief town, Boni, lies 80 m. N.E. of Macassar,
and 2½ m. from the east coast of the peninsula. The native race
of Bugis (<i>q.v.</i>), whose number within this area is about 70,000,
is one of the most interesting in the whole archipelago.</p>

<p>Boni was once the most powerful state of Celebes, all the
other princes being regarded as vassals of its ruler, but its history
is not known in detail. In 1666 the rajah Palakkah, whose
father and grandfather had been murdered by the family of
Hassan, the tyrant of Sumatra, made common cause with the
Dutch against that despot. From that date till the beginning
of the 19th century Dutch influence in the state remained undisputed.
In 1814, however, Boni fell into the hands of the
British, who retained it for two years; but by the European
treaties concluded on the downfall of Napoleon it reverted to
its original colonizers. Their influence, however, was resisted
more than once by the natives. An expedition in 1825, under
General van Geen, was not fully successful in enforcing it;
and in 1858 and the following year two expeditions were
necessary to oppose an attempt by the princess regent towards
independence. In 1860 a new prince, owning allegiance to the
Dutch, was set up. As in other native states in Celebes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span>
succession to the throne in the female line has precedence over
the male line.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BONIFACE, SAINT<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> (680-754), the apostle of Germany, whose
real name was Wynfrith, was born of a good Saxon family at
Crediton or Kirton in Devonshire. While still young he became
a monk, and studied grammar and theology first at Exeter, then
at Nutcell near Winchester, under the abbot Winberht. He
soon distinguished himself both as scholar and preacher, and had
every inducement to remain in his monastery, but in 716 he
followed the example of other Saxon monks and set out as
missionary to Frisia. He was soon obliged to return, however,
probably owing to the hostility of Radbod, king of the Frisians,
then at war with Charles Martel. At the end of 717 he went to
Rome, where in 719 Pope Gregory II. commissioned him to
evangelize Germany and to counteract the influence of the Irish
monks there. Crossing the Alps, Boniface visited Bavaria and
Thuringia, but upon hearing of the death of Radbod he hurried
again to Frisia, where, under the direction of his countryman
Willibrord (d. 738), the first bishop of Utrecht, he preached
successfully for three years. About 722 he visited Hesse and
Thuringia, won over some chieftains, and converted and baptized
great numbers of the heathen. Having sent special word to
Gregory of his success, he was summoned to Rome and consecrated
bishop on the 30th of November 722, after taking an oath
of obedience to the pope. Then his mission was enlarged. He returned
with letters of recommendation to Charles Martel, charged
not only to convert the heathen but to suppress heresy as well.</p>

<p>Charles&rsquo;s protection, as he himself confessed, made possible
his great career. Armed with it he passed safely into heathen
Germany and began a systematic crusade, baptizing, overturning
idols, founding churches and monasteries, and calling from
England a band of missionary helpers, monks and nuns, some of
whom have become famous: St Lull, his successor in the see at
Mainz; St Burchard, bishop of Würzburg; St Gregory, abbot at
Utrecht; Willibald, his biographer; St Lioba, St Walburge, St
Thecla. In 732 Boniface was created archbishop. In 738 for
the third time he went to Rome. On his return he organized the
church in Bavaria into the four bishoprics of Regensburg, Freising,
Salzburg and Passau. Then his power was extended still further.
In 741 Pope Zacharias made him legate, and charged him with the
reformation of the whole Frankish church. With the support of
Carloman and Pippin, who had just succeeded Charles Martel as
mayors of the palace, Boniface set to work. As he had done
in Bavaria, he organized the east Frankish church into four
bishoprics, Erfurt, Würzburg, Buraburg and Eichstädt, and set
over them his own monks. In 742 he presided at what is generally
counted as the first German council. At the same period he
founded the abbey of Fulda, as a centre for German monastic
culture, placing it under the Bavarian Sturm, whose biography
gives us so many picturesque glimpses of the time, and making
its rule stricter than the Benedictine. Then came a theological
and disciplinary controversy with Virgil, the Irish bishop of
Salzburg, who held, among other heresies, that there were other
worlds than ours. Virgil must have been a most remarkable
man; in spite of his leanings toward science he held his own
against Boniface, and was canonized after his death. Boniface
was more successful in France. There a certain Adalbert or
Aldebert, a Frankish bishop of Neustria, had caused great
disturbance. He had been performing miracles, and claimed to
have received his relics, not from Rome like those of Boniface,
but directly from the angels. Planting crosses in the open fields
he drew the people to desert the churches, and had won a great
following throughout all Neustria. Opinions are divided as to
whether he was a Culdee, a representative of a national Frankish
movement, or simply the charlatan that Boniface paints him.
At the instance of Pippin, Boniface secured Adalbert&rsquo;s condemnation
at the synod of Soissons in 744; but he, and Clement, a
Scottish missionary and a heretic on predestination, continued to
find followers in spite of legate, council and pope, for three or
four years more.</p>

<p>Between 746 and 748 Boniface was made bishop of Mainz, and
became metropolitan over the Rhine bishoprics and Utrecht, as
well as over those he had established in Germany&mdash;thus founding
the pre-eminence of the see of Mainz. In 747 a synod of the
Frankish bishops sent to Rome a formal statement of their
submission to the papal authority. The significance of this act
can only be realized when one recalls the tendencies toward the
formation of national churches, which had been so powerful
under the Merovingians. Boniface does not seem to have taken
part in the anointing of Pippin as king of the Franks in 752. In
754 he resigned his archbishopric in favour of Lull, and took up
again his earliest plan of a mission to Frisia; but on the 5th of
June 754 he and his companions were massacred by the heathen
near Dockum. His remains were afterwards taken to Fulda.</p>

<p>St Boniface has well been called the proconsul of the papacy.
His organizing genius, even more than his missionary zeal, left its
mark upon the German church throughout all the middle ages.
The missionary movement which until his day had been almost
independent of control, largely carried on by schismatic Irish
monks, was brought under the direction of Rome. But in so
welding together the scattered centres and binding them to the
papacy, Boniface seems to have been actuated by simple zeal for
unity of the faith, and not by a conscious political motive.</p>

<p>Though pre-eminently a man of action, Boniface has left several
literary remains. We have above all his Letters (<i>Epistolae</i>),
difficult to date, but extremely important from the standpoint of
history, dogma, or literature; see Dümmler&rsquo;s edition in the
<i>Monumenta Germaniae historica</i>, 1892. Besides these there are
a grammar (<i>De octo partibus orationibus</i>, ed. Mai, in <i>Classici
Auctores</i>, t. vii.), some sermons of contested authenticity, some
poems (<i>Aenigmata</i>, ed. Dümmler, <i>Poetae latini aevi Carolini</i>, i.
1881), a penitential, and some <i>Dicta Bonifacii</i> (ed. Nürnberger
in <i>Theologische Quartalschrift</i>, Tübingen, vol. 70, 1888), the
authenticity of which it is hard to prove or to refute. Migne
in his <i>Patrologia Latina</i> (vol. 89) has reproduced the edition of
Boniface&rsquo;s works by Giles (London, 1844).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There are very many monographs on Boniface and on different
phases of his life (see Potthast, <i>Bibliotheca medii aevi</i>, and Ulysse
Chevalier&rsquo;s <i>Bibliographie</i>, 2nd ed. for indications), but none that is
completely satisfactory. Among recent studies are those of B.
Kuhlmann, <i>Der heilige Bonifatius, Apostel der Deutschen</i> (Paderborn,
1895), and of G. Kurth, <i>Saint Boniface</i> (2nd ed., 1902). W. Levison
has edited the <i>Vitae sancti Bonifatii</i> (Hanover, 1905).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BONIFACE<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> (<i>Bonifacius</i>), the name of nine of the popes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Boniface I.</span>, bishop of Rome from 418 to 422. At the death
of Pope Zosimus, the Roman clergy were divided into two
factions, one of which elected the deacon Eulalius, and the
other the priest Boniface. The imperial government, in the
interests of public order, commanded the two competitors to
leave the town, reserving the decision of the case to a council.
Eulalius having broken his ban, the emperor Honorius decided
to recognize Boniface, and the council was countermanded.
But the faction of Eulalius long continued to foment disorders,
and the secular authority was compelled to intervene.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Boniface II.</span>, pope from 530 to 532, was by birth a Goth,
and owed his election to the nomination of his predecessor,
Felix IV., and to the influence of the Gothic king. The Roman
electors had opposed to him a priest of Alexandria called
Dioscorus, who died a month after his election, and thus left
the position open for him. Boniface endeavoured to nominate
his own successor, thus transforming into law, or at least into
custom, the proceeding by which he had benefited; but the
clergy and the senate of Rome forced him to cancel this
arrangement.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Boniface III.</span> was pope from the 15th of February to the
12th of November 606. He obtained from Phocas recognition
of the &ldquo;headship of the church at Rome,&rdquo; which signifies, no
doubt, that Phocas compelled the patriarch of Constantinople
to abandon (momentarily) his claim to the title of oecumenical
patriarch.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Boniface IV.</span> was pope from 608 to 615. He received from
the emperor Phocas the Pantheon at Rome, which was converted
into a Christian church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Boniface V.</span>, pope from 619 to 625, did much for the christianizing
of England. Bede mentions (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i>) that he wrote
encouraging letters to Mellitus, archbishop of Canterbury, and
Justus, bishop of Rochester, and quotes three letters&mdash;to Justus,
to Eadwin, king of Northumbria, and to his wife Æthelberga.
William of Malmesbury gives a letter to Justus of the year 625,
in which Canterbury is constituted the metropolitan see of
Britain for ever.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Boniface VI.</span> was elected pope in April 896, and died fifteen
days afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Boniface VII.</span> was pope from August 984 to July 985. His
family name was Franco. In 974 he was substituted by Crescentius
and the Roman barons for Benedict VI., who had been
assassinated. He was ejected by Count Sicco, the representative
of the emperor Otto II., and fled to Constantinople. On the
death of Otto (983) he returned, seized Pope John XIV., threw
him into prison, and installed himself in his place.</p>
<div class="author">(L. D.*)</div>

<p><span class="sc">Boniface VIII.</span> (Benedetto Gaetano), pope from 1294 to
1303, was born of noble family at Anagni, studied canon and
civil law in Italy and possibly at Paris. After being appointed
to canonicates at Todi (June 1260) and in France, he became
an advocate and then a notary at the papal court. With
Cardinal Ottoboni, who was to aid the English king, Henry III.,
against the bishops of the baronial party, he was besieged in the
Tower of London by the rebellious earl of Gloucester, but was
rescued by the future Edward I., on the 27th of April 1267.
Created cardinal deacon in 1281, and in 1291 cardinal priest
(SS. Sylvestri et Martini), he was entrusted with many diplomatic
missions and became very influential in the Sacred College.
He helped the ineffective Celestine V. to abdicate, and was himself
chosen pope at Naples on the 24th of December 1294.
Contrary to custom, the election was not made unanimous,
probably because of the hostility of certain French cardinals.
Celestine attempted to rule in extreme monastic poverty and
humility; not so Boniface, who ardently asserted the lordship
of the papacy over all the kingdoms of the world. He was
crowned at Rome in January 1295 with great pomp. He
planned to pacify the West and then recover the Holy Land
from the infidel; but during his nine years&rsquo; reign, so far from
being a peacemaker, he involved the papacy itself in a series
of controversies with leading European powers. Avarice, lofty
claims and frequent exhibitions of arrogance made him many
foes. The policy of supporting the interests of the house of
Anjou in Sicily proved a grand failure. The attempt to build
up great estates for his family made most of the Colonna his
enemies. Until 1303 he refused to recognize Albert of Austria
as the rightful German king. Assuming that he was overlord
of Hungary, he declared that its crown should fall to the house
of Anjou. He humbled Eric VI. of Denmark, but was unsuccessful
in the attempt to try Edward I., the conqueror of Scotland,
on the charge of interfering with a papal fief; for parliament
declared in 1301 that Scotland had never been a fief of Rome.
The most noted conflict of Boniface was that with Philip IV.
of France. In 1296, by the bull <i>Clericis laicos</i>, the pope forbade
the levying of taxes, however disguised, on the clergy without
his consent. Forced to recede from this position, Boniface
canonized Louis IX. (1297). The hostilities were later renewed;
in 1302 Boniface himself drafted and published the indubitably
genuine bull <i>Unam sanctam</i>, one of the strongest official statements
of the papal prerogative ever made. The weight of
opinion now tends to deny that any part of this much-discussed
document save the last sentence bears the marks of an infallible
utterance. The French vice-chancellor Guillaume de Nogaret
was sent to arrest the pope, against whom grave charges had
been brought, and bring him to France to be deposed by an
oecumenical council. The accusation of heresy has usually
been dismissed as a slander; but recent investigations make
it probable, though not quite certain, that Boniface privately
held certain Averroistic tenets, such as the denial of the immortality
of the soul. With Sciarra Colonna, Nogaret surprised
Boniface at Anagni, on the 7th of September 1303, as the latter
was about to pronounce the sentence of excommunication
against the king. After a nine-hours&rsquo; truce the palace was
stormed, and Boniface was found lying in his bed, a cross
clasped to his breast; that he was sitting in full regalia on the
papal throne is a legend. Nogaret claimed that he saved the
pope&rsquo;s life from the vengeful Colonna. Threatened, but not
maltreated, the pope had remained three days under arrest
when the citizens of Anagni freed him. He was conducted to
Rome, only to be confined in the Vatican by the Orsini. He
died on the 11th or 12th of October 1303, not eighty-six years
old, as has commonly been believed, but perhaps under seventy,
at all events not over seventy-five. &ldquo;He shall come in like a
fox, reign like a lion, die like a dog,&rdquo; is a gibe wrongly held to be
a prophecy of his unfortunate predecessor. Dante, who had
become embittered against Boniface while on a political mission
in Rome, calls him the &ldquo;Prince of the new Pharisees&rdquo; (<i>Inferno</i>,
27, 85), but laments that &ldquo;in his Vicar Christ was made a captive,&rdquo;
and was &ldquo;mocked a second time&rdquo; (<i>Purgatory</i>, 20, 87 f.).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Boniface IX.</span> (Piero Tomacelli), pope from 1389 to 1404,
was born at Naples of a poor but ancient family. Created
cardinal by Urban VI., he was elected successor to the latter
on the 2nd of November 1389. In 1391 he canonized Birgitta
of Sweden. He was able to restore Roman authority in the
major part of the papal states, and in 1398 put an end to the
republican liberties of the city itself. Boniface won Naples,
which had owed spiritual allegiance to the antipopes Clement VII.
and Benedict XIII. of Avignon, to the Roman obedience. In
1403 he ventured at last to confirm the deposition of the emperor
Wenceslaus and the election of Rupert. Negotiations for the
healing of the Great Schism were without result. In spite of
his inferior education, the contemporaries of Boniface trusted
his prudence and moral character; yet when in financial straits
he sold offices, and in 1399 transformed the annates into a permanent
tax. In 1390 he celebrated the regular jubilee, but a
rather informal one held in 1400 proved more profitable.
Though probably not personally avaricious, he was justly
accused of nepotism. He died on the 1st of October 1404, being
still under sixty years of age.</p>

though a man of violent temper and too often absent from his
see, showed some sympathy with the reforming party in the
English church. Though in 1250 he provoked the English
bishops by claiming the right of visitation in their dioceses, he
took the lead at the council of Merton (1258) in vindicating the
privileges of his order. In the barons&rsquo; war he took the royalist

<p><span class="bold">BONIFACIO,<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> a maritime town at the southern extremity of
Corsica, in the arrondissement of Sartène, 87 m. S.S.E. of Ajaccio
by road. Pop. (1906) 2940. Bonifacio, which overlooks the
straits of that name separating Corsica from Sardinia, occupies
a remarkable situation on the summit of a peninsula of white
calcareous rock, extending parallel to the coast and enclosing
a narrow and secure harbour. Below the town and in the cliffs
facing it the rock is hollowed into caverns accessible only by boat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>208</span>
St Dominic, a church built in the 13th century by the Templars,
and the cathedral of Santa Maria Maggiore which belongs mainly
to the 12th century, are the chief buildings. The fortifications
and citadel date from the 16th and 17th centuries. A massive
medieval tower serves as a powder-magazine. The trade of Bonifacio,
which is carried on chiefly with Sardinia, is in cereals, wine,
cork and olive-oil of fine quality. Cork-cutting, tobacco-manufacture
and coral-fishing are carried on. The olive is largely cultivated
in the neighbourhood and there are oil-works in the town.</p>

<p>Bonifacio was founded about 828 by the Tuscan marquis
whose name it bears, as a defence against the Saracen pirates.
At the end of the 11th century it became subject to Pisa, and
at the end of the 12th was taken and colonized by the Genoese,
whose influence may be traced in the character of the population.
In 1420 it heroically withstood a protracted siege by Alphonso V.
of Aragon. In 1554 it fell into the hands of the Franco-Turkish
army.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONIFACIUS<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> (d. 432), the Roman governor of the province
of Africa who is generally believed to have invited the Vandals
into that province in revenge for the hostile action of Placidia,
ruling in behalf of her son the emperor Valentinian III. (428-429).
That action is by Procopius attributed to his rival Aëtius, but
the earliest authorities speak of a certain Felix, chief minister
of Placidia, as the calumniator of Bonifacius. Whether he really
invited the Vandals or not, there is no doubt that he soon turned
against them and bravely defended the city of Hippo from their
attacks. In 432 he returned to Italy, was received into favour
by Placidia, and appointed master of the soldiery. Aëtius, however,
resented his promotion, the two rivals met, perhaps in
single combat, and Bonifacius, though victorious, received a
wound from the effects of which he died three months later.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONIN ISLANDS,<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> called by the Japanese <span class="sc">Ogasawara-Jima</span>,
a chain of small islands belonging to Japan, stretching nearly
due north and south, a little east of 142 E., and from 26° 35&prime;
to 27° 45&prime; N., about 500 m. from the mainland of Japan. They
number twenty, according to Japanese investigations, and have
a coast-line of 174.65 m. and a superficies of 28.82 sq. m. Only
ten of them have any appreciable size, and these are named&mdash;commencing
from the north&mdash;Muko-shima (Bridegroom Island),
Nakadachi-shima (Go-between Island<a name="fa1m" id="fa1m" href="#ft1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a>), Yome-shima (Bride
Island), Ototo-jima (Younger-brother Island), Ani-shima (Elder-brother
Island), Chichi-jima (Father Island), Haha-jima (Mother
Island), Mei-jima (Niece Island), Ani-jima (Elder-sister Island)
and Imoto-jima (Younger-sister Island). European geographers
have been accustomed to divide the islands into three groups for
purposes of nomenclature, calling the northern group the Parry
Islands, the central the Beechey Islands and the southern the
Coffin or Bailey Islands. The second largest of all, Chichi-jima,
in Japanese cartography was called Peel Island in 1827 by
Captain Beechey, and the same officer gave the name of Stapleton
Island to the Ototo-jima of the Japanese, and that of Buckland
Island to their Ani-jima. To complete this account of Captain
Beechey&rsquo;s nomenclature, it may be added that he called a large
bay on the south of Peel Island Fitton Bay, and a bay on the
south-west of Buckland Island Walker Bay.<a name="fa2m" id="fa2m" href="#ft2m"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Port Lloyd, the
chief anchorage (situated on Peel Island), is considered by
Commodore Perry&mdash;who visited the islands in 1853 and strongly
urged the establishment of a United States coaling station there&mdash;to
have been formerly the crater of a volcano from which the
surrounding hills were thrown up, the entrance to the harbour
being a fissure through which lava used to pour into the sea.
The islands are, indeed, plainly volcanic in their nature.</p>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;The diversity of nomenclature indicated above
suggests that the ownership of the islands was for some time
doubtful. According to Japanese annals they were discovered
towards the close of the 16th century, and added to the fief of
a Daimyo, Ogasawa Sadayori, whence the name Ogasawara-jima.
They were also called <i>Bunin-jima</i> (corrupted by foreigners
into Bonin) because of their being without (<i>bu</i>) inhabitants (<i>nin</i>).
Effective occupation did not take place, however, and communications
with the islands ceased altogether in 1635, as was a
natural consequence of the Japanese government&rsquo;s veto against
the construction of sea-going vessels. In 1728 fitful communication
was restored by the then representative of the Ogasawara
family, only to be again interrupted until 1861, when an unsuccessful
attempt was made to establish a Japanese colony at Port
Lloyd. Meanwhile, Captain Beechey visited the islands in the
&ldquo;Blossom,&rdquo; assigned names to some of them, and published a
description of their features. Next a small party consisting of
two British subjects, two American citizens, and a Dane, sailed
from the Sandwich Islands for Port Lloyd in 1830, taking with
them some Hawaiian natives. These colonists hoisted the
British flag on Peel Island (Chichi-jima), and settled there.
When Commodore Perry arrived in 1853, there were on Peel
Island thirty-one inhabitants, four being English, four American,
one Portuguese and the rest natives of the Sandwich Islands, the
Ladrones, &amp;c.; and when Mr Russell Robertson visited the place
in 1875, the colony had grown to sixty-nine, of whom only five
were pure whites. Mr Robertson found them without education,
without religion, without laws and without any system of government,
but living comfortably on clearings of cultivated land.
English was the language of the settlers, and they regarded
themselves as a British colony. But in 1861 the British government
renounced all claim to the islands in recognition of Japan&rsquo;s
right of possession. There is now regular steam communication;
the affairs of the islands are duly administered, and the population
has grown to about 4500. There are no mountains of any
considerable height in the Ogasawara Islands, but the scenery
is hilly with occasional bold crags. The vegetation is almost
tropically luxuriant&mdash;palms, wild pineapples, and ferns growing
profusely, and the valleys being filled with wild beans and patches
of taro. Mr Robertson catalogues a number of valuable timbers
that are obtained there, among them being Tremana, cedar,
rose-wood, iron-wood (red and white), box-wood, sandal and
white oak. The kekop tree, the orange, the laurel, the juniper,
the wild cactus, the curry plant, wild sage and celery flourish.
No minerals have been discovered. The shores are covered
with coral; earthquakes and tidal waves are frequent, the latter
not taking the form of bores, but of a sudden steady rise and
equally sudden fall in the level of the sea; the climate is rather
tropical than temperate, but sickness is almost unknown among
the residents.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONITZ, HERMANN<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> (1814-1888), German scholar, was born
at Langensalza in Saxony on the 29th of July 1814. Having
studied at Leipzig under G. Hermann and at Berlin under
Böckh and Lachmann, he became successively teacher at the
Blochmann institute in Dresden (1836), Oberlehrer at the
Friedrich-Wilhelms gymnasium (1838) and the Graues Kloster
(1840) in Berlin, professor at the gymnasium at Stettin (1842),
professor at the university of Vienna (1849), member of the
imperial academy (1854), member of the council of education
(1864), and director of the Graues Kloster gymnasium (1867).
He retired in 1888, and died on the 25th of July in that year at
Berlin. He took great interest in higher education, and was
chiefly responsible for the system of teaching and examination
in use in the high schools of Prussia after 1882. But it is as a
commentator on Plato and Aristotle that he is best known
outside Germany. His most important works in this connexion
are: <i>Disputationes Platonicae Duae</i> (1837); <i>Platonische Studien</i>
(3rd ed., 1886); <i>Observations Criticae in Aristotelis Libros
Metaphysicos</i> (1842); <i>Observationes Criticae in Aristotelis quae
feruntur Magna Moralia et Ethica Eudemia</i> (1844); <i>Alexandri
Aphrodisiensis Commentarius in Libras Metaphysicos Aristotelis</i>
(1847); <i>Aristotelis Metaphysica</i> (1848-1849); <i>Über die Kategorien
des A.</i> (1853); <i>Aristotelische Studien</i> (1862-1867);
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span>
<i>Index Aristotelicus</i> (1870). Other works: <i>Über den Ursprung der
homerischen Gedichte</i> (5th ed., 1881); <i>Beiträge zur Erklärung des
Thukydides</i> (1854), <i>des Sophokles</i> (1856-1857). He also wrote
largely on classical and educational subjects, mainly for the
<i>Zeitschrift für die österreichischen Gymnasien</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A full list of his writings is given in the obituary notice by T.
Gompertz in the <i>Biographisches Jahrbuch für Altertumskunde</i> (1890).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BONIVARD, FRANÇOIS<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> (1493-1570), the hero of Byron&rsquo;s
poem, <i>The Prisoner of Chillon</i>, was born at Seyssel of an old
Savoyard family. Bonivard has been described as &ldquo;a man of
the Renaissance who had strayed into the age of the Reformation.&rdquo;
His real character and history are, however, widely
different from the legendary account which was popularized by
Byron. In 1510 he succeeded his uncle, who had educated him,
as prior of the Cluniac priory of St Victor, close to Geneva.
He naturally, therefore, opposed the attempts of the duke of
Savoy, aided by his relative, the bishop of the city, to maintain
his rights as lord of Geneva. He was imprisoned by the duke
at Gex from 1519 to 1521, lost his priory, and became more and
more anti-Savoyard. In 1530 he was again seized by the duke
and imprisoned for four years underground, in the castle of
Chillon, till he was released in 1536 by the Bernese, who then
wrested Vaud from the duke. He had been imprisoned for
political reasons, for he did not become a Protestant till after
his release, and then found that his priory had been destroyed
in 1534. He obtained a pension from Geneva, and was four
times married, but owing to his extravagances was always in
debt. He was officially entrusted in 1542 with the task of
compiling a history of Geneva from the earliest times. In 1551
his MS. of the <i>Chroniques de Genève</i> (ending in 1530) was submitted
to Calvin for correction, but it was not published till
1831. The best edition is that of 1867. The work is uncritical
and partial, but is his best title to fame.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BONN,<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span> a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine province,
on the left bank of the Rhine, 15 m. S. by E. from Cologne, on
the main line of railway to Mainz, and at the junction of the
lines to the Eifel and (by ferry) to the right bank of the Rhine.
Pop. (1885) 35,989; (1905) 81,997. The river is here crossed
by a fine bridge (1896-1898), 1417 ft. in length, flanked by
an embankment 2 m. long, above and parallel with which is
the Coblenzer-strasse, with beautiful villas and pretty gardens
reaching down to the Rhine. The central part of the town is
composed of narrow streets, but the outskirts contain numerous
fine buildings, and the appearance of the town from the river
is attractive. There are six Roman Catholic and two Protestant
churches, the most important of which is the Münster (minster),
an imposing edifice of grey stone, in the Romanesque and
Transition styles, surmounted by five towers, of which the
central, rising to a height of 315 ft., is a landmark in the Rhine
valley. The church dates from the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries,
was restored in 1875 and following years and in 1890-1894 was
adorned with paintings. Among other churches are the Stiftskirche
(monasterial church), rebuilt 1879-1884; the Jesuitenkirche
(1693); the Minoritenkirche (1278-1318), the Herz
Jesu-kirche (1862) and the Marienkirche (1892). There is also
a synagogue, and the university chapel serves as an English
church. The town also possesses a town hall situate on the
market square and dating from 1737, a fine block of law-court
buildings, several high-grade schools and a theatre.</p>

<p>By far the finest of the buildings, however, is the famous
university, which occupies the larger part of the southern
frontage of the town. The present establishment only dates
from 1818, and owes its existence to King Frederick William III.
of Prussia; but as early as 1786 the academy which had been
founded about nine years before was raised by Archbishop
Maximilian Frederick of Cologne to the rank of a university,
and continued to exercise its functions till 1794, when it was
dissolved by the last elector. The building now occupied by the
university was originally the electoral palace, constructed about
1717 out of the materials of the old fortifications. It was
remodelled after the town came into Prussian possession. There
are five faculties in the university&mdash;a legal, a medical, and a
philosophic, and one of Roman Catholic and another Protestant
theology. The library numbers upwards of 230,000 volumes;
and the antiquarian museum contains a valuable collection of
Roman relics discovered in the neighbourhood. Connected with
the university are also physiological, pathological and chemical
institutes, five clinical departments and a laboratory. An
academy of agriculture, with a natural history museum and
botanic garden attached, is established in the palace of Clemensruhe
at Poppelsdorf, which is reached by a fine avenue about a
mile long, bordered on both sides by a double row of chestnut
trees. A splendid observatory, long under the charge of Friedrich
Wilhelm Argelander, stands on the south side of the road. The
Roman Catholic archiepiscopal theological college, beautifully
situated on an eminence overlooking the Rhine, dates from 1892.</p>

<p>Beethoven was born in Bonn, and a statue was erected to him
in the Münster-platz in 1845. B.G. Niebuhr is buried in the
cemetery outside of the Sterntor, where a monument was placed
to his memory by Frederick William IV. Here are also the
tombs of A.W. von Schlegel, the diplomatist Christian Karl
von Bunsen, Robert Schumann, Karl Simrock, E.M. Arndt
and Schiller&rsquo;s wife. The town is adorned with a marble monument
commemorating the war of 1870-71, a handsome fountain,
and a statue of the Old Catholic bishop Reinkens. In 1889 a
museum of Beethoven relics was opened in the house in which
the composer was born. There are further a municipal museum,
arranged in a private house since 1882, an academic art museum
(1884), with some classic originals, a creation of F.G. Welcker,
and the provincial museum, standing near the railway station,
which contains a collection of medieval stone monuments and
works of art, besides a small picture gallery.</p>

<p>One of the most conspicuous features of Bonn, viewed from
the river, is the pilgrimage (monastic) church of Kreuzberg
(1627), behind and above Poppelsdorf; it has a flight of 28
steps, which pilgrims used to ascend on their knees. &ldquo;Der alte
Zoll,&rdquo; commanding a magnificent view of the Siebengebirge, is
the only remaining bulwark of the old fortifications, the Sterntor
having been removed in order to open up better communication
with the rapidly increasing western suburbs and the terminus
of the light railway to Cologne.</p>

<p>But for its university Bonn would be a place of comparatively
little importance, its trade and commerce being of moderate
dimensions. Its principal industries are jute spinning and
weaving, and the manufacture of porcelain, flags, machinery
and beer, and it has some trade in wine. There are considerable
numbers of foreign residents, notably English, attracted by the
natural beauty of the place and by the educational facilities it
affords.</p>

<p>Bonn (<i>Bonna</i> or <i>Castra Bonnensia</i>), originally a town of the
Ubii, became at an early period the site of a Roman military
settlement, and as such is frequently mentioned by Tacitus.
It was the scene, in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70, of a battle in which the Romans
were defeated by Claudius Civilis, the valiant leader of the
Batavians. Greatly reduced by successive barbarian inroads, it
was restored about 359 by the emperor Julian. In the centuries
that followed the break-up of the Roman empire it again suffered
much from barbarian attacks, and was finally devastated in
889 by bands of Norse raiders who had sailed up the Rhine.
It was again fortified by Konrad von Hochstaden, archbishop
of Cologne (1238-1261), whose successor, Engelbert von Falkenburg
(d. 1274), driven out of his cathedral city by the townspeople,
established himself here (1265); from which time until
1794 it remained the residence of the electors of Cologne. During
the various wars that devastated Germany in the 16th, 17th and
18th centuries, the town was frequently besieged and occupied by
the several belligerents, but continued to belong to the electors
till 1794, when the French took possession of it. At the peace of
Lunéville they were formally recognized in their occupation;
but in 1815 the town was made over by the congress of Vienna
to Prussia. The fortifications had been dismantled in 1717.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONNAT, LÉON JOSEPH FLORENTIN<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> (1833-   &emsp;&emsp;), French
painter, was born at Bayonne on the 20th of June 1833. He was
educated in Spain, under Madrazo at Madrid, and his long series
of portraits shows the influence of Velasquez and the Spanish
realists. In 1869 he won a medal of honour at Paris, where he
became one of the leading artists of his day, and in 1888 he
became professor of painting at the École des Beaux Arts. In
May 1905 he succeeded Paul Dubois as director. His vivid
portrait-painting is his most characteristic work, but his subject
pictures, such as the &ldquo;Martyrdom of St Denis&rdquo; in the Panthéon,
are also famous.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BONNE-CARRÈRE, GUILLAUME DE<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> (1754-1825), French
diplomatist, was born at Muret in Languedoc on the 13th of
February 1754. He began his career in the army, but soon
entered the diplomatic service under Vergennes. A friend of
Mirabeau and of Dumouriez, he became very active at the Revolution,
and Dumouriez re-established for him the title of director-general
of the department of foreign affairs (March 1792). He
remained at the ministry, preserving the habits of the diplomacy
of the old régime, until December 1792, when he was sent to
Belgium as agent of the republic, but he was involved in the
treason of Dumouriez and was arrested on the 2nd of April 1793.
To justify himself, he published an account of his conduct from
the beginning of the Revolution. He was freed from prison in
July 1794. Napoleon did not trust him, and gave him only
some unimportant missions. After 1815 Bonne-Carrère retired
into private life, directing a profitable business in public carriages
between Paris and Versailles.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BONNER, EDMUND<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> (1500?-1569), bishop of London, was
perhaps the natural son of George Savage, rector of Davenham,
Cheshire, by Elizabeth Frodsham, who was afterwards married
to Edmund Bonner, a sawyer of Hanley in Worcestershire.
This account, which was printed with many circumstantial
details by Strype (<i>Eccles. Mem.</i> III. i. 172-173), was disputed by
Strype&rsquo;s contemporary, Sir Edmund Lechmere, who asserted on
not very satisfactory evidence (<i>ib. Annals</i>, I. ii. 300)that Bonner
was of legitimate birth. He was educated at Broadgates Hall,
now Pembroke College, Oxford, graduating bachelor of civil
and canon law in June 1519. He was ordained about the same
time, and admitted D.C.L. in 1525. In 1529 he was Wolsey&rsquo;s
chaplain, and he was with the cardinal at Cawood at the time of
his arrest. Subsequently he was transferred, perhaps through
Cromwell&rsquo;s influence, to the service of the king, and in January
1532 he was sent to Rome to obstruct the judicial proceedings
against Henry in the papal curia. In October 1533 he was entrusted
with the unmannerly task of intimating to Clement VII.,
while he was the guest of Francis I. at Marseilles, Henry&rsquo;s appeal
from the pope to a general council; but there seems to be no
good authority for Burnet&rsquo;s story that Clement threatened to
have him burnt alive. For these and other services Bonner
had been rewarded by the grant of several livings, and in 1535
he was made archdeacon of Leicester.</p>

<p>Towards the end of that year he was sent to further what he
called &ldquo;the cause of the Gospel&rdquo; (<i>Letters and Papers</i>, 1536,
No. 469) in North Germany; and in 1536 he wrote a preface to
Gardiner&rsquo;s <i>De vera Obedientia</i>, which asserted the royal, denied
the papal, supremacy, and was received with delight by the
Lutherans. After a brief embassy to the emperor in the spring of
1538, Bonner superseded Gardiner at Paris, and began his mission
by sending Cromwell a long list of accusations against his predecessor
(<i>ib</i>. 1538, ii. 144). He was almost as bitter against
Wyatt and Mason, whom he denounced as a &ldquo;papist,&rdquo; and the
violence of his conduct led Francis I. to threaten him with a
hundred strokes of the halberd. He seems, however, to have
pleased his patron, Cromwell, and perhaps Henry, by his energy
in seeing the king&rsquo;s &ldquo;Great&rdquo; Bible in English through the press
in Paris. He was already king&rsquo;s chaplain; his appointment
at Paris had been accompanied by promotion to the see of
Hereford, and before he returned to take possession he was translated
to the bishopric of London (October 1539).</p>

<p>Hitherto Bonner had been known as a somewhat coarse and
unscrupulous tool of Cromwell, a sort of ecclesiastical Wriothesley,
He is not known to have protested against any of the changes
effected by his masters; he professed to be no theologian, and
was wont, when asked theological questions, to refer his interrogators
to the divines. He had graduated in law, and not in
theology. There was nothing in the Reformation to appeal
to him, except the repudiation of papal control; and he was
one of those numerous Englishmen whose views were faithfully
reflected in the Six Articles. He became a staunch Conservative,
and, apart from his embassy to the emperor in 1524-1543, was
mainly occupied during the last years of Henry&rsquo;s reign in
brandishing the &ldquo;whip with six strings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The accession of Edward VI opened a fresh and more creditable
chapter in Bonner&rsquo;s career. Like Gardiner, he could
hardly repudiate that royal supremacy, in the establishment
of which he had been so active an agent; but he began to doubt
that supremacy when he saw to what uses it could be put by
a Protestant council, and either he or Gardiner evolved the
theory that the royal supremacy was in abeyance during a royal
minority. The ground was skilfully chosen, but it was not
legally nor constitutionally tenable. Both he and Gardiner
had in fact sought fresh licences to exercise their ecclesiastical
jurisdiction from the young king; and, if he was supreme enough
to confer jurisdiction, he was supreme enough to issue the injunctions
and order the visitation to which Bonner objected. Moreover,
if a minority involved an abeyance of the royal supremacy in
the ecclesiastical sphere, it must do the same in the temporal
sphere, and there could be nothing but anarchy. It was on this
question that Bonner came into conflict with Edward&rsquo;s government.
He resisted the visitation of August 1547, and was
committed to the Fleet; but he withdrew his opposition, and
was released in time to take an active part against the government
in the parliament of November 1547. In the next session,
November 1548-March 1549, he was a leading opponent of the
first Act of Uniformity and Book of Common Prayer. When
these became law, he neglected to enforce them, and on the
1st of September 1549 he was required by the council to maintain
at St Paul&rsquo;s Cross that the royal authority was as great
as if the king were forty years of age. He failed to comply,
and after a seven days&rsquo; trial he was deprived of his bishopric
by an ecclesiastical court over which Cranmer presided, and
was sent to the Marshalsea. The fall of Somerset in the following
month raised Bonner&rsquo;s hopes, and he appealed from Cranmer
to the council. After a struggle the Protestant faction gained
the upper hand, and on the 7th of February 1550 Bonner&rsquo;s
deprivation was confirmed by the council sitting in the Star
Chamber, and he was further condemned to perpetual
imprisonment.</p>

<p>He was released by Mary&rsquo;s accession, and was at once restored
to his see, his deprivation being regarded as invalid and Ridley
as an intruder. He vigorously restored Roman Catholicism in
his diocese, made no difficulty about submitting to the papal
jurisdiction which he had forsworn, and in 1555 began the
persecution to which he owes his fame. His apologists explain
that his action was merely &ldquo;official,&rdquo; but Bonner was one of those
who brought it to pass that the condemnation of heretics to the
fire should be part of his ordinary official duties. The enforcement
of the first Book of Common Prayer had also been part of
his official duties; and the fact that Bonner made no such
protest against the burning of heretics as he had done in the
former case shows that he found it the more congenial duty.
Tunstal was as good a Catholic as Bonner; he left a different
repute behind him, a clear enough indication of a difference in
their deeds.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Bonner did not go out of his way to persecute;
many of his victims were forced upon him by the council,
which sometimes thought that he had not been severe enough
(see <i>Acts of the P.C. 1554-1556</i>, pp. 115, 139; <i>1556-1558</i>,
pp. 18, 19, 216, 276). So completely had the state dominated
the church that religious persecutions had become state persecutions,
and Bonner was acting as an ecclesiastical sheriff in
the most refractory district of the realm. Even Foxe records
instances in which Bonner failed to persecute. But he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>211</span>
no mercy for a fallen foe; and he is seen at his worst in his
brutal jeers at Cranmer, when he was entrusted with the duty
of degrading his former chief. It is a more remarkable fact that,
in spite of his prominence, neither Henry VIII. nor Mary should
ever have admitted him to the privy council. He seems to
have been regarded by his own party as a useful instrument,
especially in disagreeable work, rather than as a desirable
colleague.</p>

<p>On her accession Elizabeth refused to allow him to kiss her
hand; but he sat and voted in the parliament and convocation
of 1559. In May he refused to take the oath of supremacy,
acquiring like his colleagues consistency with old age. He was
sent to the Marshalsea, and a few years later was indicted on
a charge of praemunire on refusing the oath when tendered
him by his diocesan, Bishop Horne of Winchester. He challenged
the legality of Horne&rsquo;s consecration, and a special act of parliament
was passed to meet the point, while the charge against
Bonner was withdrawn. He died in the Marshalsea on the 5th
of September 1569, and was buried in St George&rsquo;s, Southwark, at
midnight to avoid the risk of a hostile demonstration.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONNET, CHARLES<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> (1720-1793), Swiss naturalist and
philosophical writer, was born at Geneva on the 13th of March
1720, of a French family driven into Switzerland by the religious
persecution in the 16th century. He made law his
profession, but his favourite pursuit was the study of natural
science. The account of the ant-lion in N.A. Pluche&rsquo;s <i>Spectacle
de la nature</i>, which he read in his sixteenth year, turned his
attention to insect life. He procured R.A.F. de Réaumur&rsquo;s
work on insects, and with the help of live specimens succeeded
in adding many observations to those of Réaumur and Pluche.
In 1740 Bonnet communicated to the academy of sciences a paper
containing a series of experiments establishing what is now
termed parthenogenesis in <i>aphides</i> or tree-lice, which obtained
for him the honour of being admitted a corresponding member
of the academy. In 1741 he began to study reproduction by
fusion and the regeneration of lost parts in the freshwater hydra
and other animals; and in the following year he discovered
that the respiration of caterpillars and butterflies is performed
by pores, to which the name of <i>stigmata</i> has since been given.
In 1743 he was admitted a fellow of the Royal Society; and in
the same year he became a doctor of laws&mdash;his last act in
connexion with a profession which had ever been distasteful
to him.</p>

<p>His first published work appeared in 1745, entitled <i>Traité
d&rsquo;insectologie</i>, in which were collected his various discoveries
regarding insects, along with a preface on the development of
germs and the scale of organized beings. Botany, particularly
the leaves of plants, next attracted his attention; and after
several years of diligent study, rendered irksome by the increasing
weakness of his eyesight, he published in 1754 one of the
most original and interesting of his works, <i>Recherches sur l&rsquo;usage
des feuilles dans les plantes</i>; in which among other things he
advances many considerations tending to show (as has quite
recently been done by Francis Darwin) that plants are endowed
with powers of sensation and discernment. But Bonnet&rsquo;s eyesight,
which threatened to fail altogether, caused him to turn
to philosophy. In 1754 his <i>Essai de psychologie</i> was published
anonymously in London. This was followed by the <i>Essai
analytique sur les facultés de l&rsquo;âme</i> (Copenhagen, 1760), in which
he develops his views regarding the physiological conditions of
mental activity. He returned to physical science, but to the
speculative side of it, in his <i>Considérations sur les corps organisés</i>
(Amsterdam, 1762), designed to refute the theory of epigenesis,
and to explain and defend the doctrine of pre-existent germs.
In his <i>Contemplation de la nature</i> (Amsterdam, 1764-1765;
translated into Italian, German, English and Dutch), one of his
most popular and delightful works, he sets forth, in eloquent
language, the theory that all the beings in nature form a gradual
scale rising from lowest to highest, without any break in its
continuity. His last important work was the <i>Palingénésie
philosophique</i> (Geneva, 1769-1770); in it he treats of the past
and future of living beings, and supports the idea of the survival
of all animals, and the perfecting of their faculties in a future
state.</p>

<p>Bonnet&rsquo;s life was uneventful. He seems never to have left
Switzerland, nor does he appear to have taken any part in public
affairs except for the period between 1752 and 1768, during which
he was a member of the council of the republic. The last twenty
five years of his life he spent quietly in the country, at Genthod,
near Geneva, where he died after a long and painful illness on
the 20th of May 1793. His wife was a lady of the family of
De la Rive.</p>

<p>They had no children, but Madame Bonnet&rsquo;s nephew, the
celebrated H.B. de Saussure, was brought up as their son.</p>

<p>Bonnet&rsquo;s philosophical system may be outlined as follows.
Man is a compound of two distinct substances, mind and body,
the one immaterial and the other material. All knowledge
originates in sensations; sensations follow (whether as physical
effects or merely as sequents Bonnet will not say) vibrations in
the nerves appropriate to each; and lastly, the nerves are made
to vibrate by external physical stimulus. A nerve once set in
motion by a particular object tends to reproduce that motion;
so that when it a second time receives an impression from the
same object it vibrates with less resistance. The sensation
accompanying this increased flexibility in the nerve is, according
to Bonnet, the condition of memory. When reflection&mdash;that is,
the active element in mind&mdash;is applied to the acquisition and
combination of sensations, those abstract ideas are formed
which, though generally distinguished from, are thus merely
sensations in combination only. That which puts the mind
into activity is pleasure or pain; happiness is the end of human
existence. Bonnet&rsquo;s metaphysical theory is based on two
principles borrowed from Leibnitz&mdash;first, that there are not
successive acts of creation, but that the universe is completed
by the single original act of the divine will, and thereafter moves
on by its own inherent force; and secondly, that there is no
break in the continuity of existence. The divine Being originally
created a multitude of germs in a graduated scale, each
with an inherent power of self-development. At every successive
step in the progress of the universe, these germs, as
progressively modified, advance nearer to perfection; if some
advanced and others did not there would be a gap in the continuity
of the chain. Thus not man only but all other forms of
existence are immortal. Nor is man&rsquo;s mind alone immortal;
his body also will pass into the higher stage, not, indeed, the
body he now possesses, but a finer one of which the germ at
present exists within him. It is impossible, however, to reach
absolute perfection, because the distance is infinite. In this
final proposition Bonnet violates his own principle of continuity,
by postulating an interval between the highest created being
and the Divine. It is also difficult to understand whether the
constant advance to perfection is performed by each individual,
or only by each race of beings as a whole. There seems, in fact,
to be an oscillation between two distinct but analogous doctrines&mdash;that
of the constantly increasing advancement of the individual
in future stages of existence, and that of the constantly increasing
advancement of the race as a whole according to the successive
evolutions of the globe.</p>

the common term in English till the end of the 17th century;
this sense survives in Scotland, especially as applied to the cap

means an additional piece laced on to the bottom, but it seems
to have formerly meant a piece laced to the top, the term &ldquo;to

century to mean &ldquo;strike sail&rdquo; (from the Fr. <i>avaler</i>), to let
down. In modern times &ldquo;bonnet&rdquo; has come to be used of a type of
head-covering for women, differentiated from &ldquo;hat&rdquo; by fitting
closely to the head and often having no brim, but varying
considerably in shape according to the period and fashion.
The term, by a natural extension, is also applied to certain

<p><span class="bold">BONNEVAL, CLAUDE ALÉXANDRE,<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> <span class="sc">Comte de</span> (1675-1747),
French adventurer, known also as <span class="sc">Ahmed Pasha</span>, was the
descendant of an old family of Limousin. He was born on the
14th of July 1675, and at the age of thirteen joined the Royal
Marine Corps. After three years he entered the army, in which
he rose to the command of a regiment. He served in the Italian
campaigns under Catinat, Villeroi and Vendôme, and in the
Netherlands under Luxemburg, giving proofs of indomitable
courage and great military ability. His insolent bearing towards
the minister of war was made matter for a court-martial (1704).
He was condemned to death, but saved himself by flight to
Germany. Through the influence of Prince Eugene he obtained
a general&rsquo;s command in the Austrian army, and fought with
great bravery and distinction against France, and afterwards
against Turkey. He was present at Malplaquet, and was severely
wounded at Peterwardein. The proceedings against him in
France were then allowed to drop, and he visited Paris, and
married a daughter of Marshal de Biron. He returned, however,
after a short time to the Austrian army, and fought with
distinction at Belgrade. He might now have risen to the highest
rank, had he not made himself disagreeable to Prince Eugene,
who sent him as master of the ordnance to the Low Countries.
There his ungovernable temper led him into a quarrel with the
marquis de Prié, Eugene&rsquo;s deputy governor in the Netherlands,
who answered his challenge by placing him in confinement.
A court-martial was again held upon him, and he was
condemned to death; but the emperor commuted the sentence
to one year&rsquo;s imprisonment and banishment. Bonneval, soon
after his release, offered his services to the Turkish government,
professed the Mahommedan faith, and took the name of Ahmed.
He was made a pasha, and appointed to organize and command
the artillery. He rendered valuable services to the sultan in
his war with Russia, and with the famous Nadir Shah. As a
reward he received the governorship of Chios, but he soon fell
under the suspicion of the Porte, and was banished for a time
to the shores of the Black Sea. He was meditating a return to
Europe and Christianity when he died at Constantinople on the
23rd of March 1747.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONNEVILLE, BENJAMIN L. E.<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> (1795-1878), American
military engineer and explorer, was born in France about 1795.
He emigrated to the United States in early youth, and graduated
at the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1815.
He was engaged in the construction of military roads in the
south-west, and became a captain of infantry in 1825. In
1831-1836, having obtained leave of absence from the army,
he conducted, largely on his own responsibility, an exploring
expedition to the Rocky Mountains, proceeding up the Platte
river through parts of the later states of Colorado and Wyoming
into the Great Salt Lake basin and thence into California. After
being absolutely cut off from civilization for several years, and
having his name struck from the army list, he returned with an
interesting and valuable account of his adventures, which was
edited and amplified by Washington Irving and published under
the title <i>The Rocky Mountains: or Scenes, Incidents, and
Adventures in the Far West; from the Journal of Captain Benjamin
L.E. Bonneville of the Army of the United States</i> (2 vols., 1837),
subsequent editions bearing the title <i>The Adventures of Captain
Bonneville, U.S.A., in the Rocky Mountains and the Far West.</i>
Bonneville became a major in 1845, and was breveted lieutenant-colonel
for gallantry in the battles of Contreras and Churubusco
during the Mexican War. He became a colonel in 1855, commanded
the Gila river expedition against the Apaches in 1857,
and from 1858 to 1861 commanded the department of New
Mexico. He was retired in 1861, but served during the Civil
War as recruiting officer and commandant of barracks at
St Louis, Missouri, receiving the brevet rank of brigadier-general
in 1865. He died at Fort Smith, Arkansas, on the 12th
of June 1878. The extinct glacial lake which once covered
what is now north-western Utah has been named in his honour.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONNEY, THOMAS GEORGE<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> (1833-&emsp;&emsp;), English geologist,
eldest son of the Rev. Thomas Bonney, master of the grammar
school at Rugeley, was born in that town on the 27th of July
1833. Educated at Uppingham and St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge,
he graduated as 12th wrangler in 1856, and was ordained
in the following year. From 1856 to 1861 he was mathematical
master at Westminster school, and geology was pursued by him
only as a recreation, mainly in Alpine regions. In 1868 he was
appointed tutor at St John&rsquo;s College and lecturer in geology.
His attention was specially directed to the study of the igneous
and metamorphic rocks in Alpine regions and in various parts of
England, in the Lizard, at Salcombe, in Charnwood Forest, in
Wales and the Scottish Highlands. In 1877 he was chosen
professor of geology in University College, London. He became
secretary and afterwards president of the Geological Society
(1884-1886), secretary of the British Association (1881-1885),
president of the Mineralogical Society and of the Alpine Club.
He was also in 1887 appointed honorary canon of Manchester.
His purely scientific works are: <i>Cambridgeshire Geology</i> (1875);
<i>The Story of our Planet</i> (1893); <i>Charles Lyell and Modern Geology</i>
(1895); <i>Ice Work, Past and Present</i> (1896); <i>Volcanoes</i> (1899).
In addition to many papers published in the <i>Quarterly Journal
of the Geological Society</i> and <i>Geological Magazine</i>, he wrote
several popular works on Alpine Regions, on English and Welsh
scenery, as well as on theological subjects.</p>

French diplomatist, was a member of the Legislative
Assembly and of the Convention, where he voted with the
majority. During the Directory he was charged with diplomatic
missions, first to Lille and then to the congress of Rastadt
(October 1797), where the negotiations dragged wearily along
and were finally broken. On the 28th of April 1799 the
plenipotentiaries on leaving Rastadt were assailed at the gates of
the town by Hungarian hussars, probably charged to secure their

French soldier, was the younger brother of Artus
Gouffier, seigneur de Boisy, tutor of Francis I. of France.
Bonnivet was brought up with Francis, and after the young
king&rsquo;s accession he became one of the most powerful of the
royal favourites. In 1515 he was made admiral of France. In
the imperial election of 1519 he superintended the candidature
of Francis, and spent vast sums of money in his efforts to secure
the votes of the electors, but without success. He was the
implacable enemy of the constable de Bourbon and contributed
to his downfall. In command of the army of Navarre in 1521,
he occupied Fuenterrabia and was probably responsible for its
non-restoration and for the consequent renewal of hostilities.
He succeeded Marshal Lautrec in 1523 in the command of the
army of Italy and entered the Milanese, but was defeated and
forced to effect a disastrous retreat, in which the chevalier
Bayard perished. He was one of the principal commanders of
the army which Francis led into Italy at the end of 1524, and
died at the battle of Pavia on the 24th of February 1525. Brantôme
says that it was at Bonnivet&rsquo;s suggestion that the battle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>213</span>
of Pavia was fought, and that, seeing the disaster he had caused,
he courted and found death heroically in the fight. In spite of
his failures as a general and diplomatist, his handsome face
and brilliant wit enabled him to retain throughout his life the
intimacy and confidence of his king. He was a man of licentious
life. According to Brantôme he was the successful rival of the
king for the favours of Madame de Châteaubriand, and if we
may believe him to have been&mdash;as is very probable&mdash;the hero
of the fourth story of the <i>Heptameron</i>, Marguerite d&rsquo;Angoulême

<p><span class="bold">BONOMI, GIUSEPPI<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> (1739-1808), English architect, was
born at Rome on the 19th of January 1739. After attaining
a considerable reputation in Italy, he came in 1767 to England,
and finally settled in practice there. He was the innocent cause
of the retirement of Sir Joshua Reynolds from the presidency
of the Royal Academy. Sir Joshua wished him to become a
full Academician, regarding him as a fitting occupant of the then
vacant chair of perspective. But the majority of the Academicians
were opposed to this suggestion, and Bonomi was elected
an associate only, and that merely by the president&rsquo;s casting
vote. Bonomi was largely responsible for the revival of classical
architecture in England. His most famous work was the Italian
villa at Roseneath, Dumbartonshire, designed for the duke of
Argyll. In 1804 he was appointed honorary architect to St Peter&rsquo;s
at Rome. He died in London on the 9th of March 1808.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Giuseppi Bonomi</span> (1796-1878), studied art in London
at the Royal Academy, and became a sculptor, but is best known
as an illustrator of the leading Egyptological publications of his
day. From 1824 to 1832 he was in Egypt, making drawings
of the monuments in the company of Burton, Lane and Wilkinson.
In 1833 he visited the mosque of Omar, returning with
detailed drawings, and from 1842 to 1844 was again in Egypt,
attached to the Prussian government exploration expedition
under Lepsius. He assisted in the arrangement of the Egyptian
court at the Crystal Palace in 1853, and in 1861 was appointed
curator of the Soane Museum. He died on the 3rd of March

<p><span class="bold">BONONCINI<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Buononcini</span>), <span class="bold">GIOVANNI BATTISTA</span> (1672?-1750?),
Italian musical composer, was the son of the composer
Giovanni Maria Bononcini, best known as the author of a treatise
entitled <i>Il Musico Prattico</i> (Bologna, 1673), and brother of the
composer Marc&rsquo; Antonio Bononcini, with whom he has often
been confused. He is said to have been born at Modena in
1672, but the date of his birth must probably be placed some
ten years earlier. He was a pupil of his father and of Colonna,
and produced his first operas, <i>Tullo Ostilio</i> and <i>Serse</i>, at Rome
in 1694. In 1696 he was at the court of Berlin, and between
1700 and 1720 divided his time between Vienna and Italy.
In 1720 he was summoned to London by the Royal Academy
of Music, and produced several operas, enjoying the protection
of the Marlborough family. About 1731 it was discovered
that he had a few years previously palmed off a madrigal by
Lotti as his own work, and after a long correspondence he was
obliged to leave the country. He remained for several years in
France, and in 1748 was summoned to Vienna to compose music
in honour of the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. He then went to
Venice as a composer of operas, and nothing more is known of
his life.</p>

<p>Bononcini&rsquo;s rivalry with Handel will always ensure him
immortality, but he was in himself a musician of considerable
merit, and seems to have influenced the style, not only of Handel
but even of Alessandro Scarlatti. Either he or his brother (our
knowledge of the two composers&rsquo; lives is at present not sufficient
to distinguish their works clearly) was the inventor of that
sharply rhythmical style conspicuous in <i>Il Trionfo di Camilla</i>
(1697), the success of which at Naples probably induced Scarlatti
to adopt a similar type of melody. It is noticeable in the
once popular air of Bononcini, <i>L&rsquo;esperto nocchiero</i>, and in the air
<i>Vado ben spesso</i>, long attributed to Salvator Rosa, but really
by Bononcini.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BONONIA<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> (mod. <i>Bologna</i>), the chief town of ancient Aemilia
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aemilia, Via</a></span>), in Italy. It was said by classical writers
to be of Etruscan origin, and to have been founded, under the
name Felsina, from Perusia by Aucnus or Ocnus. Excavations
of recent years have, however, led to the discovery of some
600 ancient Italic (Ligurian?) huts, and of cemeteries of the
same and the succeeding (Umbrian) periods (800-600? <span class="scs">B.C.</span>),
of which the latter immediately preceded the Etruscan civilization
(<i>c</i>. 600-400 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). An extensive Etruscan necropolis,
too, was discovered on the site of the modern cemetery (A.
Zannoni, <i>Scavi della Certosa</i>, Bologna, 1876), and others in the
public garden and on the Arnoaldi Veli property (<i>Notizie degli
Scavi, indice</i> 1876-1900, <i>s.v.</i> &ldquo;Bologna&rdquo;). In 196 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, when
the town first appears in history, it was already in the possession
of the Boii, and had probably by this time changed its name,
and in 189 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> it became a Roman colony. After the conquest
of the mountain tribes, its importance was assured by its position
on the Via Aemilia, by which it was connected in 187 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> with
Ariminum and Placentia, and on the road, constructed in the
same year, to Arretium; while another road was made, perhaps
in 175 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, to Aquilelia. It thus became the centre of the road
system of north Italy. In 90 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> it acquired Roman citizenship.
In 43 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> it was used as his base of operations against Decius
Brutus by Mark Antony, who settled colonists here; Augustus
added others later, constructing a new aqueduct from the Letta,
a tributary of the Rhenus, which was restored to use in 1881
(G. Gozzadini in <i>Notizie degli Scavi</i>, 1881, 162). After a fire in
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 53 the emperor Claudius made a subvention of 10 million
sesterces (£1,087,500). Bononia seems, in fact, to have been
one of the most important cities of ancient Italy, as Bologna is
of modern Italy. It was able to resist Alaric in 410 and to
preserve its existence during the general ruin. It afterwards
belonged to the Greek exarchate of Ravenna. Of remains of
the Roman period, however, there are none above ground,
though various discoveries have been made from time to time
within the city walls, the modern streets corresponding more or
less, as it seems, with the ancient lines. Remains of the bridge
of the Via Aemilia over the Rhenus have also been found&mdash;
consisting of parts of the parapets on each side, in brick-faced
concrete which belong to a restoration, the original construction
(probably by Augustus in 2 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) having been in blocks of
Veronese red marble&mdash;and also of a massive protecting wall
slightly above it, of late date, in the construction of which a large
number of Roman tombstones were used. The bed of the river
was found to have risen at least 20 ft. since the collapse of this
bridge (about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1000), the total length of which must have
been about 650 ft. and the width between the parapets 38½ ft.</p>

serving as a surgeon in the French army and studying under J.N.
Corvisart at Paris, he accompanied A. von Humboldt during
five years of travel in Mexico, Colombia and the districts bordering
on the Orinoco and Amazon. In these explorations he
collected and classified about 6000 plants till then mostly unknown
in Europe, which he afterwards described in <i>Plantes
équinoxiales</i>, &amp;c. (Paris, 1808-1816). On returning to Paris he
received a pension and the superintendence of the gardens at
Malmaison, and published <i>Monographie des Mélastomées</i> (1806),
and <i>Description des plantes rares de Navarre</i> (1813). In 1816
he set out, taking with him various European plants, for Buenos
Aires, where he was elected professor of natural history, an office
which he soon quitted in order to explore central South America.
While journeying to Bolivia he was arrested in 1821, by command
of Dr Francia, the dictator of Paraguay, who detained him until
1831. On regaining liberty he resided at San Borga in the province
of Corrientes, until his removal in 1853 to Santa Anna,

<p><span class="bold">BONSTETTEN, CHARLES VICTOR DE<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> (1745-1832), Swiss
writer, an excellent type of a liberal patrician, more French than
Swiss, and a good representative of the Gallicized Bern of the
18th century. By birth a member of one of the great patrician
families of Bern, he was educated in his native town, at Yverdon,
and (1763-1766) at Geneva, where he came under the influence of
Rousseau and of Charles Bonnet, and imbibed liberal sentiments.
Recalled to Bern by his father, he was soon sent to Leiden,
and then visited (1769) England, where he became a friend of
the poet Gray. After his father&rsquo;s death (1770) he made a long
journey in Italy, and on his return to Bern (1774) entered political
life, for which he was unfitted by reason of his liberal ideas,
which led him to patronize and encourage Johannes Müller, the
future Swiss historian. In 1779 he was named the Bernese
bailiff of Saanen or Gessenay (here he wrote his <i>Lettres pastorales
sur une contrée de la Suisse</i>, published in German in 1781), and in
1787 was transferred in a similar capacity to Nyon, from which
post he had to retire after taking part (1791) in a festival to
celebrate the destruction of the Bastille. From 1795 to 1797 he
governed (for the Swiss Confederation) the Italian-speaking
districts of Lugano, Locarno, Mendrisio and Val Maggia, of which
he published (1797) a pleasing description, and into which he
is said to have introduced the cultivation of the potato. The
French revolution of 1798 in Switzerland drove him again into
private life. He spent the years 1798 to 1801 in Denmark, with
his friend Fredirika Brun, and then settled down in 1803 in
Geneva for the rest of his life. There he enjoyed the society of
many distinguished persons, among whom was (1809-1817)
Madame de Staël. It was during this period that he published
his most celebrated work, <i>L&rsquo;Homme du midi et l&rsquo;homme du nord</i>
(1824), a study of the influence of climate on different nations,

<p><span class="bold">BONUS<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span> (a jocular application of the Lat. <i>bonus</i>, for <i>bonum</i>,
&ldquo;a good thing&rdquo;), a sum paid to shareholders in a joint-stock
company, as an addition to the ordinary dividend, and generally
given out of accumulated profits, or out of profits gained from
exceptional transactions. As used by insurance companies, the
word denotes the addition made to the amount of a policy by
a distribution <i>pro rata</i> of accumulated profits or surplus. In
a more general sense, bonus is any payment or remuneration over
and above what is due and promised.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BONZE<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> (from Japanese <i>bonzo</i>, probably a mispronunciation
of Chinese <i>fan sung</i>, &ldquo;religious person&rdquo;), the European name
for the members of the Buddhist religious orders of Japan and
China. The word is loosely used of all the Buddhist priests in
those and the neighbouring countries.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOOK,<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> the common name for any literary production of some
bulk, now applied particularly to a printed composition forming
a volume, or, if in more than one volume, a single organic
literary work. The word is also used descriptively for the
internal divisions or sections of a comprehensive work.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;book&rdquo; is found with variations of form and gender
in all the Teutonic languages, the original form postulated for
it being a strong feminine <i>Bôks</i>, which must have been used in
the sense of a writing-tablet. The most obvious connexion of this
is with the old English <i>bóc</i>, a beech tree, and though this is not
free from philological difficulties, no probable alternative has
been suggested.</p>

<p>As early as 2400 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, in Babylonia, legal decisions, revenue
accounts, &amp;c. were inscribed in cuneiform characters on clay
tablets and placed in jars, arranged on shelves and labelled by
clay tablets attached by straws. In the 7th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> a
library of literary works written on such tablets existed at
Nineveh, founded by Sargan (721-705 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). As in the case of
the &ldquo;Creation&rdquo; series at the British Museum the narrative was
sometimes continued from one tablet to another, and some of
the tablets are inscribed with entries forming a catalogue of the
library. These clay tablets are perhaps entitled to be called
books, but they are out of the direct ancestry of the modern
printed book with which we are here chiefly concerned. One
of the earliest direct ancestors of this extant is a roll of eighteen
columns in Egyptian hieratic writing of about the 25th century
<span class="scs">B.C.</span> in the Musée de Louvre at Paris, preserving the maxims
of Ptah-hetep. Papyrus, the material on which the manuscript
(known as the Papyrus Prisse) is written, was made from the pith
of a reed chiefly found in Egypt, and is believed to have been in
use as a writing material as early as about 4000 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> It continued
to be the usual vehicle of writing until the early centuries of the
Christian era, was used for pontifical bulls until <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1022, and
occasionally even later; while in Coptic manuscripts, for which
its use had been revived in the 7th century, it was employed as
late as about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1250. It was from the name by which they
called the papyrus, <span class="grk" title="bublos">&#946;&#973;&#946;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> or <span class="grk" title="biblos">&#946;&#943;&#946;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, that the Greeks formed
<span class="grk" title="biblion">&#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#943;&#959;&#957;</span>, their word for a book, the plural of which (mistaken
for a feminine singular) has given us our own word Bible.
In the 2nd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Eumenes II., king of Pergamus,
finding papyrus hard to procure, introduced improvements into
the preparations of the skins of sheep and calves for writing
purposes, and was rewarded by the name of his kingdom being
preserved in the word <i>pergamentum</i>, whence our &ldquo;parchment,&rdquo;
by which the dressed material is known. In the 10th century the
supremacy which parchment had gradually established was
attacked by the introduction from the East of a new writing
material made from a pulp of linen rags, and the name of the
vanquished papyrus was transferred to this new rival. Paper-mills
were set up in Europe in the 12th century, and the use of
paper gained ground, though not very rapidly, until on the
invention of printing, the demand for a cheap material for books,
and the ease with which paper could be worked on a press, gave
it a practical monopoly. This it preserved until nearly the end
of the 19th century, when substances mainly composed of wood-pulp,
esparto grass and clay largely took its place, while continuing,
as in the transition from papyrus to linen-pulp, to pass under
the same name (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Paper</a></span>).</p>

<p>So long as the use of papyrus was predominant the usual form
of a book was that of the <i>volumen</i> or roll, wound round a stick,
or sticks. The modern form of book, called by the Latins <i>codex</i>
(a word originally used for the stump of a tree, or block of wood,
and thence for the three-leaved tablets into which the block was
sawn) was coming into fashion in Martial&rsquo;s time at Rome, and
gained ground in proportion as parchment superseded papyrus.
The <i>volumen</i> as it was unrolled revealed a series of narrow
columns of writing, and the influence of this arrangement is
seen in the number of columns in the earliest codices. Thus in
the Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus of the Bible, both of
the 4th century, there are respectively four and three columns
to a page; in the Codex Alexandrinus (5th century) only two;
in the Codex Bezae (6th century) only one, and from this date
to the invention of printing, while there were great changes
in handwriting, the arrangement of books changed very little,
single or double columns being used as was found convenient.
In the external form of books there was much the same conservatism.
In the Codex Amiatinus written in England in the 8th
century one of the miniatures shows a book in a red leather cover,
and the arrangement of the pattern on this curiously resembles
that of the 15th-century red leather bindings predominant
in the Biblioteca Laurenziana at Florence, in which the codex
itself is preserved. In the same way some of the small stamps
used in Oxford bindings in the 15th century are nearly indistinguishable
from those used in England three centuries earlier.
Much fuller details as to the history of written books in these as
well as other respects will be found in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Manuscript</a></span>,
to which the following account of the fortunes of books after the
invention of printing must be regarded as supplementary.</p>

<p>Between a manuscript written in a formal book-hand and an
early printed copy of the same work, printed in the same district
as the manuscript had been written, the difference in general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>215</span>
appearance was very slight. The printer&rsquo;s type (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Typography</a></span>)
would as a rule be based on a handwriting considered by the
scribes appropriate to works of the same class; the chapter
headings, headlines, initial-letters, paragraph marks, and in some
cases illustrations, would be added by hand in a style which might
closely resemble the like decorations in the manuscript from which
the text was being printed; there would be no title-page, and
very probably no statement of any kind that the book was
printed, or as to where, when or by whom it was produced.
Information as to these points, if given at all, was reserved for
a paragraph at the end of the book, called by bibliographers
a colophon (<i>q.v.</i>), to which the printer often attached a device
consisting of his arms, or those of the town in which he worked,
or a fanciful design. These devices are sometimes beautiful and
often take the place of a statement of the printer&rsquo;s name. Many
facsimiles or copies of them have been published.<a name="fa1n" id="fa1n" href="#ft1n"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The first
dated title-page known<a name="fa2n" id="fa2n" href="#ft2n"><span class="sp">2</span></a> is a nine-line paragraph on an otherwise
blank page giving the title of the book, <i>Sermo ad populum
predicabilis in festo presentacionis Beatissime Marie Semper
Virginis</i>, with some words in its praise, the date 1470 in roman
numerals, and a reference to further information on the next
page. The book in which this title-page occurs was printed by
Arnold ther Hoernen at Cologne. Six years later Erhard Ratdolt
and his partners at Venice printed their names and the date,
together with some verses describing the book, on the title-page
of a Latin calendar, and surrounded the whole with a border
in four pieces. For another twenty years, however, when title-pages
were used at all, they usually consisted merely of the short
title of the book, with sometimes a woodcut or the printer&rsquo;s
(subsequently the publisher&rsquo;s) device beneath it, decoration being
more often bestowed on the first page of text, which was sometimes
surrounded by an ornamental border. Title-pages completed
by the addition of the name and address of printer or publisher,
and also by the date, did not become common till about 1520.</p>

<p>While the development of the title-page was thus slow the
completion of the book, independently of handwork, in other
respects was fairly rapid. Printed illustrations appear first in the
form of rude woodcuts in some small books produced at Bamberg
by Albrecht Pfister about 1461. Pagination and headlines
were first used by ther Hoernen at Cologne in 1470 and 1471;
printed signatures to guide binders in arranging the quires correctly
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bibliography and Bibliology</a></span>) by Johann Koelhoff,
also at Cologne in 1472. Illustrations abound in the books
printed at Augsburg in the early &rsquo;seventies, and in the &rsquo;eighties
are common in Germany, France and the Low Countries, while
in Italy their full development dated from about 1490. Experiments
were made in both Italy and France with illustrations
engraved on copper, but in the 15th century these met with no
success.</p>

<p>Bound with wooden boards covered with stamped leather,
or with half of the boards left uncovered, many of the earliest
printed books are immensely large and heavy, especially the great
choir-books, the Bibles and the Biblical and legal commentaries,
in which a great mass of notes surrounds the text. The paper
on which these large books were printed was also extraordinarily
thick and strong. For more popular books small folio was at
first a favourite size, but towards the end of the century small
thin quartos were much in vogue. Psalters, books of hours,
and other prayer-books were practically the only very small
books in use. Owing to changes, not only in the value of money
but in the coinage, the cost of books in the 15th century is extremely
difficult to ascertain. A vellum copy of the first printed
Bible (Mainz, c. 1455) in two large folio volumes, when rubricated
and illuminated, is said to have been worth 100 florins. In 1467
the bishop of Aleria writing to Pope Paul II. speaks of the
introduction of printing having reduced prices to one-fifth of
what they had previously been. Fifteen &ldquo;Legends&rdquo; bequeathed
by Caxton to St Margaret&rsquo;s, Westminster, were sold at prices
varying from 6s. 8d. to 5s. This would be cheap for a large work
like the <i>Golden Legend</i>, but the bequest was more probably of
copies of the Sarum <i>Legenda</i>, or Lectionary, a much smaller book.</p>

<p><i>16th Century</i>.&mdash;The popularization of the small octavo by Aldus
at Venice in 1501 and the introduction in these handy books of
a new type, the italic, had far-reaching consequences. Italics
grew steadily in favour during the greater part of the century, and
about 1570 had almost become the standard vernacular type of
Italy. In France also they were very popular, the attempt to
introduce a rival French cursive type (<i>lettres de civilité</i>) attaining
no success. In England they gained only slight popularity,
but roman type, which had not been used at all in the 15th
century, made steady progress in its contest with black letter,
which by the end of the century was little used save for Bibles
and proclamations. The modern practice in the use of i and
j, u and v dates from about 1580, though not firmly established
till the reign of Charles I.</p>

<p>In the second quarter of the 16th century the French printers
at Paris and Lyons halved the size of the Aldine octavos in their
small sextodecimos, which found a ready market, though not
a lasting one, the printers of Antwerp and Leiden ousting them
with still smaller books in 24mo or small twelves. These little
books were printed on paper much thinner than had previously
been used. The size and weight of books was also reduced by
the substitution of pasteboards for wooden sides. Gold tooling
came into use on bindings, and in the second half of the century
very elaborate decoration was in vogue in France until checked
by a sumptuary law. On the other hand a steady decline in the
quality of paper combined with the abandonment of the old
simple outline woodcuts for much more ambitious designs made
it increasingly difficult for printers to do justice to the artists&rsquo;
work, and woodcuts, at first in the Low Countries and afterwards
in England and elsewhere, were gradually superseded by copper-plates
printed separately from the text. At the beginning of this
century in England a ballad or Christmas carol sold for a halfpenny
and thin quarto chapbooks for 4d. (a price which lasted through
the century), the Great Bible of 1541 was priced at 10s. in sheets
and 12s. bound, Edward VI.&rsquo;s prayer-book (1549) at 2s. 2d.
unbound, and 3s. 8d. in paste or boards; Sidney&rsquo;s <i>Arcadia</i> and
other works in 1598 sold for 9s.</p>

<p><i>17th Century</i>.&mdash;Although the miniature editions issued by the
Elzevirs at Leiden, especially those published about 1635, have
attracted collectors, printing in the 17th century was at its worst,
reaching its lowest depths in England in the second quarter.
After this there was a steady improvement, partly due to
slight modifications of the old printing presses, adopted first in
Holland and copied by the English printers. In the first half
of the century many English books, although poorly printed,
were ornamented with attractive frontispieces, or portraits,
engraved on copper. During the same period, English prayer-books
and small Bibles and New Testaments were frequently
covered with gay embroideries in coloured silks and gold or silver
thread. In the second half of the century the leather bindings
of Samuel Mearne, to some extent imitated from those of the
great French binder Le Gascon, were the daintiest England had
yet produced. For trade bindings rough calf and sheepskin
were most used, and the practice of lettering books on the back,
instead of on the sides or fore-edges or not at all, came gradually
into favour. Owing to the increase of money, and in some cases
to the action of monopolists, in others to the increased payments
made to authors, book-prices rather rose than fell. Thus church
Bibles, which had been sold at 10s. in 1541, rose successively to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>216</span>
25s., 30s. and (in 1641) to 40s. Single plays in quarto cost
6d. each in Shakespeare&rsquo;s time, 1s. after the Restoration. The
Shakespeare folio of 1623 is said to have been published at £1.
Bishop Walton&rsquo;s polyglot Bible in six large volumes was sold
for £10 to subscribers, but resulted in a heavy loss. Izaak
Walton&rsquo;s <i>Compleat Angler</i> was priced at 1s. 6d. in sheepskin,
<i>Paradise Lost</i> at 3s., <i>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i> at 1s. 6d.; Dryden&rsquo;s
<i>Virgil</i> was published by subscription at £5:5s. It was a handsome
book, ornamented with plates; but in the case of this and
other subscription books a desire to honour or befriend the author
was mainly responsible for the high price.</p>

<p><i>18th Century</i>.&mdash;During this century there was a notable improvement
alike in paper, type and presswork in both France
and England, and towards the end of the century in Germany
and Italy also. Books became generally neat and sometimes
elegant. Book-illustration revived with the French <i>livres-à-vignettes</i>,
and English books were illustrated by Gravelot and other
French artists. In the last quarter of the century the work of
Bewick heralded a great revival in woodcut illustrations, or as
the use of the graver now entitled them to be called, wood
engravings. The best 18th-century binders, until the advent of
Roger Payne, were inferior to those of the 17th century, but the
technique of the average work was better. In trade bindings
the use of sheepskin and calf became much less common, and
books were mostly cased in paper boards. The practice of publishing
poetry by subscription at a very high price, which Dryden
had found lucrative, was followed by Prior and Pope. Single
poems by Pope, however, were sold at 1s. and 1s. 6d. Novels
were mostly in several volumes. The price at the beginning of the
century was mostly 1s. 6d. each. It then remained fairly steady
for many years, and at the close of the century rose again. Thus
Miss Burney&rsquo;s <i>Evelina</i> (3 vols., 1778) sold for 7s. 5d., her <i>Cecilia</i>
(5 vols., 1782) for 12s. 6d., and her <i>Camilla</i> (5 vols., 1796) for £1:1s.
Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i> (2 vols. folio, 1755) cost £4 : 4s. in sheets,
£4 : 15s. in boards.</p>

<p><i>19th Century</i>.&mdash;great change in the appearance of books was
caused by the use first of glazed calico (about 1820), afterwards
(about 1830) of cloth for the cases of books as issued by their
publishers. At first the lettering was printed on paper labels,
but soon it was stamped in gilt on the cloth, and in the last quarter
of the century many very beautiful covers were designed for
English and American books. The designs for leather bindings
were for many years chiefly imitated from older work, but towards
the end of the &rsquo;eighties much greater originality began
to be shown. Book illustrations passed through many phases.
As subsidiary methods colour-prints, line engravings, lithographs
and etchings were all used during the first half of the century,
but the main reliance was on wood-engraving, in which extraordinary
technical skill was developed. In the &rsquo;sixties and the
years which immediately preceded and followed them many
of the chief English artists supplied the engravers with drawings.
In the last decade of the century wood-engraving was practically
killed by the perfection attained by photographic methods of
reproduction (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Process</a></span>), the most popular of these methods
entailing the use of paper heavily coated with china clay. During
the century trade-printing, both in England and America, steadily
improved, and the work done by William Morris at his Kelmscott
Press (1891-1896), and by other amateur printers who imitated
him, set a new standard of beauty of type and ornament, and
of richness of general effect. On the other hand the demand
for cheap reprints of famous works induced by the immense
extension of the reading public was supplied by scores of pretty
if flimsy editions at 1s. 6d. and 1s. and even less. The problem
of how to produce books at moderate prices on good paper and
well sewn, was left for the 20th century to settle. About 1894
the number of such medium-priced books was greatly increased
in England by the substitution of single-volume novels at 6s.
each (subject to discount) for the three-volume editions at 31s. 6d.
The preposterous price of 10s. 6d. a volume had been adopted
during the first popularity of the <i>Waverly Novels</i>, and despite the
example of France, where the standard price was 3 fr. 50, had
continued in force for the greater part of the century. Even after
novels were sold at reasonable rates artificial prices were maintained
for books of travel and biographies, so that the circulating
libraries were practically the only customers for the first
editions. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Publishing</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bookselling</a></span>).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOOKBINDING.<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span> Bindings or covers to protect written or
printed matter have always followed the shapes of the material
on which the writing or printing was done. Very early inscriptions
on rocks or wood needed no coverings, and the earliest
<span class="sidenote">Origins.</span>
instances of protective covers are to be found among the smaller
Assyrian tablets of about the 8th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> These tablets,
with cuneiform inscriptions recording sales of slaves, loans of
money and small matters generally, are often enclosed in an
outer shell of the same shape and impressed with a short title.
Egyptian papyrus rolls were generally kept in roll form, bound
round with papyrus tape and often sealed with seals
of Nile mud; and the rolls in turn were often preserved
in rectangular hollows cut in wood. The next earliest material
to papyrus used for writing upon was tree bark. Bark books,
still commonly used by uncultured nations, often consisting of
collections of magical formulae or medical receipts, are generally
rolls, folded backwards and forwards upon themselves like the
sides of a concertina. At Pompeii in 1875 several diptychs were
found, the wooden leaves hollowed on the inner sides, filled with
blackened wax, and hinged together at the back with leather
thongs. Writings were found scratched on the wax, one of them
being a record of a payment to Umbricia Januaria in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 55.
This is the earliest known Latin manuscript. The diptychs are
the prototypes of the modern book. From about the 1st to
the 6th century, ornamental diptychs were made of carved ivory,
and presented to great personages by the Roman consuls.</p>

<p>Rolls of papyrus, vellum or paper were written upon in three
ways, (1) In short lines, at right angles to the length of the roll.
(2) In long lines each the entire length of the roll. (3) In short
lines parallel to the length of the roll, each column or page of
writing having a space left on each side of it. Rolls written in the
first of these ways were simply rolled up and kept in cylinders
of like shape, sometimes several together, with a title tag at
the end of each, in a box called a scrinium. In the case of the
second form, the most obvious instances of which are to be found
in the Buddhist prayer-wheels, the rolls were and are kept in
circular boxes with handles through the centres so that they can
revolve easily. In the third manner of arranging the manuscript
the page forms show very clearly, and it is still used in the scrolls
of the law in Jewish synagogues, kept on two rollers, one at each
end. But this form of writing also developed a new method
for its own more convenient preservation. A roll of this kind can
be folded up, backwards and forwards, the bend coming in the
vacant spaces between the columns of writing. When this is done
it at once becomes a book, and takes the Chinese and Japanese
form known as <i>orihon</i>&mdash;all the writing on one side of the roll
or strip of paper and all the other side blank. Some books of this
kind are simply guarded by two boards, but generally they are
fastened together along one of the sides, which then becomes
the back of the book. The earliest fastening of such books
consists of a lacing with some cord or fibre run through holes
stabbed right through the substance of the roll, near the edge.
Now the <i>orihon</i> is complete, and it is the link between the roll
and the book. This &ldquo;stabbed&rdquo; form of binding is the earliest
method of keeping the leaves of a book together; it occurs in
the case of a Coptic papyrus of about the 8th century found at
Thebes, but it is rarely used in the case of papyrus, as the material
is too brittle to retain the threads properly.</p>

<p>The method of folding vellum into pages seems to have been
first followed about the 5th century. The sheets were folded
once, and gatherings of four or more folded sheets were made,
so that stitches through the fold at the back would hold all the
sheets together and each leaf could be conveniently turned over.
Very soon an obvious plan of fixing several of these gatherings,
or quires, together was followed by the simple expedient of
fastening the threads at the back round a strong strip of leather
or vellum held at right angles to the line of the backs. This early
plan of &ldquo;sewing&rdquo; books is to-day used in the case of valuable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>217</span>
books; it is known as &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; work, and has never been
improved upon.</p>

<p>As soon as the method of sewing quires together in this way
became well understood, it was found that the projecting bands
at the back needed protection, so that when all the quires were
joined together and, so far, finished, strips of leather were fastened
all over the back. But it was also found that vellum leaves were
apt to curl strongly, and to counteract this tendency strong
wooden boards were put on each side. The loose ends of the
bands were fastened to the boards, which hinged upon them,
and the protecting strip of leather at the back was drawn over
the boards far enough to cover the hinge. So we get the medieval
&ldquo;half-binding&rdquo; which shows the strip of leather over the back
of the book, projecting for a short way over the boards, the rest of
which is left uncovered. The boards were usually kept closed by
means of clasps in front.</p>

<p>The leather strip soon developed, and covered the whole of
the boards, &ldquo;whole&rdquo; binding as it is called, and it was quickly
found that these fine flat pieces of leather offered a splendid field
for artistic decoration.</p>

<p>The first ornamentation on leather bindings was probably
made by means of impressions from small metal points or lines,
pressed upon the leather. This in time led to the
purposeful cutting of small decorative stamps to be
<span class="sidenote">Progress of artistic binding.</span>
used in the same way. It is considered that English
binders excelled in this art of &ldquo;blind&rdquo; stamping, that
is, without the use of gold leaf. Most of the stamps were cut
intaglio, so that their impressions are in cameo form. Such
bindings were made to perfection during the 12th and 13th
centuries at Durham, Oxford, Cambridge, London and other
places. One of the most charming examples left is the binding
of the Winchester Domesday Book of the 12th century (Plate,
fig. 1), now belonging to the Society of Antiquaries of London.</p>

<p>From about the 7th to the 16th century illuminated manuscripts
were held in the greatest esteem. Among them can be found not
only exquisite calligraphy but exquisite miniature painting.
Moreover, the gorgeousness of the illuminations inside suggested
gorgeousness of the outside coverings, so we find splendid work
in metals with jewels, enamels and carved ivory, dating from the
7th-century <i>Gospels of Theodolinda</i> at Monza, the Irish cumdach
of the <i>Stowe Missal</i>, the <i>Lindau Gospels</i> now in America, and the
<i>Gospels of Charlemagne</i> in the Victoria and Albert Museum at
South Kensington, to the magnificent bindings of 14th-century
Limoges enamel in the British Museum. Such English bindings
of this kind&mdash;intrinsically precious&mdash;as may have existed have
all disappeared,&mdash;most likely they were melted up by Henry
VIII. or Edward VI.; but at Stonyhurst there is a book known
as <i>St Cuthbert&rsquo;s Gospels</i>, which is bound in red leather with a
repoussé design upon it, and is probably the work of the 7th or
8th century (Plate, fig. 2).</p>

<p>When printing was introduced into Europe about the middle
of the 15th century, there was very soon a reaction against the
large, beautiful and valuable illuminated MSS. and their equally
precious covers. Printing brought small books, cheap books,
ugly books, generally bound in calf, goatskin or sheepskin,
and ornamented with large panel stamps in blind. But a new
art came into birth very shortly, namely the art of gold tooling
on leather, which in capable hands is almost a great art, and
specimens of the work of the few great masters that have practised
it are now much sought after and likely to increase in
estimation and value. All this, as usual, brings a school of skilled
<i>faussaires</i> into the field, and already the collector of fine bindings
must be wary, or he may easily give thousands of pounds for
forged or made-up objects that are worth but little.</p>

<p>In the matter of leather bindings with gold tooling, an art
which was probably brought to Venice from the East, the finest
examples are to be found in late 15th-century Italian work. The
art quickly spread, and Thomas Berthelet, Royal Binder to
Henry VIII., seems to have been the first binder who practised
it in England. Berthelet&rsquo;s work is strongly Italian in feeling,
especially at first, and it is likely that he was taught the new
art by an Italian master; he worked until about 1558.</p>

<p>During the late 15th and the 16th century in England, numbers
of fine printed books were bound in velvet and satin, sometimes
set with enamels, sometimes embroidered. These books, having
strong threads of metal freely used upon them, have lasted
much better than would be expected, and instances of such
work made for Henry VIII. are still in excellent condition,
and most decorative.</p>

<p>The fashion of ornamenting English royal books with heraldic
designs, which is considered to have begun in the reign of Edward
IV., has continued without break. The same fashion in books
belonging to private owners was first followed during the later
Tudor period, and then numbers were made, and have been, more
or less, ever since.</p>

<p>During the whole Tudor period several small bindings of gold
ornamented with enamels were made. Some of these still exist,
and they are charming little jewels. They were always provided
with a ring at the top, no doubt for attaching to the girdle.</p>

<p>Aldus Manutius, the great Venetian printer, had several of
his books charmingly bound in dark morocco with &ldquo;Aldine&rdquo;
knot leaves and small dolphins both in blind and gold tooling;
and Giunta, a Florentine printer, had his books bound in a
similar way but without the dolphins. Many early Venetian
bindings have recessed panels, made by the use of double boards,
the upper of which is pierced, finished in true oriental fashion.</p>

<p>Jean Grolier, viscount d&rsquo;Aguisy, treasurer of France in 1545,
was a great collector of fine books, most of which were bound for
himself, and bear upon them his legend, <i>Portio mea domine sit
in terra viventium</i>, and also his name, Io Grolierii et Amicorum
(Plate, fig. 3). Tommaso Maioli, an Italian collector of about the
same time, used the same form of legend. Books bound for him
are curiously marked with atoms of gold remaining in the irregularities
of the leather.</p>

<p>Demetrio Canevari, physician to Pope Urban VIII., had his
books bound in dark green or deep red morocco, and upon them
is a fine cameo stamp with a design of Apollo driving a chariot
with one white horse and one black horse towards a mountain
on which is a silver Pegasus. The stamp was coloured, but in
most cases the colour has now worn off. Round the stamp is
the legend <span class="grk" title="ORTHOS KAI MAE LOXIOS">&#927;&#929;&#920;&#937;&#931; &#922;&#913;&#921; &#924;&#919; &#923;&#927;&#926;&#921;&#937;&#931;</span>.</p>

<p>The Italian bindings which were made for popes and cardinals
are always of much interest and often of high merit, but as a
rule later Italian bindings are disappointing.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Tory, printer and engraver to Francis I. of France,
designed some fine bindings, some for himself and quite possibly
some for Jean Grolier.</p>

<p>For Henry II. of France much highly decorative work in binding
was done, richly gilded and coloured. These bindings have
upon them the king&rsquo;s initials, the initials of his queen, Catherine
de&rsquo; Medici, and the emblems of crescents and bows. Henry&rsquo;s
device was a crescent with the legend, <i>Donec impleat totum orbem</i>.
Bindings of similar style were made for Diane de Poitiers, duchesse
de Valentinois, with her initials and the same devices of crescents
and bows. They are always fine work.</p>

<p>German bindings are mostly in pigskin, finely stamped in
blind. Several are, however, in calf. Gilding, when it exists,
is generally bad.</p>

<p>In England during the 17th century much fine work was done
in binding, most of it in morocco, but Henry, prince of Wales,
always had his books bound in calf. The Jacobean style is
heraldic, with semis of small stamps and heavy corners, but
James I. has left some very fine bindings in another style
(Plate, fig. 4), very possibly done for him by John Gibson, who
bound the royal books while James was king of Scotland only.
During the reign of Charles I. Nicholas Ferrar founded his curious
establishment at Little Gidding, and there his niece Mary Collet
and her sisters set up a bindery. They made large scrap-books,
harmonies of the Gospels and other parts of the Bible, with
illustrations, and bound them magnificently in velvet stamped
in gold and silver. They were taught by a binder who worked
for John and Thomas Buck, printers to the university of Cambridge,
and the Little Gidding stamps are often identical with
Buck&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>218</span></p>

<p>Samuel Mearne (d. 1683) was royal binder to Charles II., and
invented the cottage style of decoration, a style which has lasted
till the present day; the Bible on which Edward VII. took the
coronation oath was ornamented in that way. An inner rectangle
is run parallel to the edges of the book, and the upper and lower
lines are broken outwards into the outline of a gable roof.
Mearne&rsquo;s work as a binder (Plate, fig. 5) is of the highest merit.
Many of his books have their fore-edge painted in such a way that
the work is invisible when the book is shut, and only shows when
the edges are fanned out.</p>

<p>In France 16th- and 17th-century binding is distinguished by
the work of such masters as Nicholas Eve, who bound the beautiful
<i>Livre des Statuts et Ordonnances de l&rsquo;ordre du Benvist Sainct
Esprit</i> for Henry III. (Plate, fig. 6); Clovis Eve, who is credited
with the invention of the style known as &ldquo;fanfare,&rdquo; a delicate
tracery over the boards of a book, filled out with spirals of leafy
stems; and Le Gascon, who invented the dotted work which has
been used more or less ever since. Le Gascon caused his small
gilding tools&mdash;curves and arabesques&mdash;to be scored across, so
that when impressions were made from them a dotted line
showed instead of a right line. Florimond Badier worked in a
style very similar to that of Le Gascon and sometimes signed his
work, which Le Gascon never did. Le Gascon had many imitators,
the best and closest being Poncyn and Magnus, Dutch
binders who worked at Amsterdam in the 17th century, and his
style has been continuously followed to the present day.</p>

<p>The bindings of Padeloup le Jeune often have small tickets
with his name upon them; they usually have borders of lace-like
gold tooling known as &ldquo;dentelle&rdquo; and are often inlaid.
He belonged to a family of binders, all of whom were excellent
workmen, and lived in the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>

<p>The Deromes were another of the great French families of
binders; the most celebrated was Nicholas Denis, called &ldquo;Le
Jeune,&rdquo; born in 1731. He used dentelle borders resembling
those of Padeloup, but with little birds interspersed among the
arabesques&mdash;&ldquo;dentelles à l&rsquo;oiseau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the many French binders of the 18th century who used
delicate inlays of coloured leathers, Jean Charles le Monnier was
perhaps the most skilled. He often signed his bindings in small
capitals impressed in gold somewhere about the inlaid part.</p>

<p>Eliot and Chapman bound the library of Robert Harley,
earl of Oxford, about the middle of the 18th century. The bindings
are in morocco, with broad, richly gold-tooled borders, and
usually a diamond-shaped centre-piece. This is known as the
Harleian style.</p>

<p>Thomas Hollis had his books bound in fine red morocco,
ornamented with small, well-cut stamps engraved by Thomas
Pingo, the medallist. These stamps comprise a cap of liberty,
a figure of liberty, a figure of Britannia and several smaller ones.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the 18th century, when binding in England
was decoratively at a low level, Roger Payne, a native of Windsor,
came to London and set up as a bookbinder. He was a splendid
workman, and introduced richly gold-tooled corner-pieces,
ornamental &ldquo;doublures&rdquo; or inside linings, and also invented the
graining of morocco, graining it, however, in one direction only,
known as the &ldquo;straight grain.&rdquo; It is said that Payne cut his own
binding tools of iron; they certainly are exquisitely made, and
in many of his bindings he has put a written description of
loving work he has done upon them. Payne was, unfortunately,
a drunkard, but he has in spite of this rendered an immortal
service to the art of bookbinding in England.</p>

<p>In 1785 John Edwards of Halifax patented a method of making
vellum transparent, and using it as a covering over delicate
paintings. He also painted pictures on the fore-edges of many
of his books in the same manner as that followed by Samuel
Mearne in the 17th century, so that they did not show until the
book was opened. John Whitaker used calf for his bindings,
but ornamented the calf in a curious way with strong acids and
with prints from engraved metal plates. Both Edwards and
Whitaker liked classical borders and ornaments, and their
bindings are in consequence often known as &ldquo;Etruscan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The main styles used in England at the beginning of the 19th
century were nothing more than distant imitations of Roger
Payne. Kalthoeber, Staggemeier, Walther and Hering were all
disciples of this master, but Charles Lewis worked on original
lines. He developed arabesques and paid particular attention
to richly gold-tooled doublures. He also used gold end papers,
and the bands at the back of his bindings are often double
and always broad, flat and gold-tooled. His workmanship is
excellent; he worked largely for Thomas Grenville and other great
collectors.</p>

<p>French binding of the 19th century is remarkable for wonderful
technical excellence in every part. Among the most skilled of
these admirable workmen and artists may be particularly mentioned
Thouvenin, Bauzonnet, Lortic, Niedrée, Capé and Duru,
and fortunately they generally sign their work in small gold
lettering either on the back of their bindings or inside along the
lower edge.</p>

<p>Recent years have witnessed a marked revival of interest in
the art of bookbinding, but modern binders have two serious
difficulties to contend with. One of these is the prevalence
of bad paper, overladen with clay and with
<span class="sidenote">Modern methods.</span>
wood pulp, and also the fact that many of the modern
leathers are badly prepared and dangerously treated with
sulphuric acid, which in time inevitably rots the fibre. The
Society of Arts has appointed committees of experts to report
upon both of these evils, and the published accounts of both
inquiries are of much value, and it is to be hoped that the results
may be beneficial. Concurrently with the revival of the artistic
side of the subject, there has also arisen a remarkable development
in the technical processes, owing to the invention of ingenious
and delicate machinery which is capable of executing the work
which had hitherto been always laboriously done by hand. The
processes of folding the printed sheets, and sewing them together
on bands, rounding the backs when sewn, and of making the
outer cases, covering them with cloth or leather and stamping
designs upon them, can now all be efficiently executed by means
of machines. The saving in time and labour thus effected is very
great, although it must be said that the old methods of carrying
out the process of sewing and rounding the backs of books by
hand labour were safer and stronger, as well as being much less
liable to bruise and injure the paper. These processes unfortunately
are not only slow but also necessitate highly skilled labour.
Already the larger trade binders utilize machines extensively
and advantageously, but exclusively high-class trade binders
do not as yet materially depart from the older methods. Private
binders have naturally no reason to use machines at all. Fine
and delicate examples of large metal blocks or dies have been
very successfully used for the decoration of covers measuring
about 11½ by 8 in.</p>

<p>Besides the large trade binders working mainly by the help
of machinery, and producing a great quantity of bound work
which is not expected to last long, there also exists in London,
Paris, New York and other large cities, a small class of art
binders who work throughout upon the principles which have
been continuously in use for first-class work ever since about
the 5th century. The initial impetus to this school can be
traced to William Morris, who himself made some beautiful
designs for bookbindings, to be executed both in gold and in
blind. Although he probably did not fully appreciate either the
peculiar limitations or the possibilities of the art of gold-tooling
on leather, nevertheless his genius guided him truly as to the
spirit in which the designs should be conceived. The revived art
soon reached its first stage of development under the guidance
of Mr T.J. Cobden-Sanderson, who may fairly be considered
as the founder of the modern school of design for gold-tooling
on book-covers, the pre-eminence and individuality of his work
in this direction being proved by the number of his imitators.
Among the most successful of his pupils is Mr Douglas Cockerell,
whose work (Plate, fig. 7) is distinguished by a marked originality
of treatment, while it shows a scholarly appreciation of ancient
methods. Mr Alfred de Sauty has succeeded in developing a
new and admirable style in inlaid leathers, combined with delicate
pointille work. A number of women artists, both in England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>219</span>
and in America, have already discovered in bookbinding a fitting
and lucrative field for their energies. One, Miss Sarah Prideaux,
is not only skilled and original in her own work, but she has also
given us much valuable literature on her subject. Miss E.M.
MacColl may claim to be the inventor of the small curved gold
line produced by means of a tiny wheel, for though the possibility
of producing such a line in blind was known for a long time,
it was rarely used. The graceful curves and lines found on Miss
MacColl&rsquo;s work have been designed for her by her brother,
Mr D.S. MacColl (Plate, fig. 8). Miss Joanna Birkenruth
recalls the highly decorative medieval binding by her use of
jewels cut <i>en cabochon</i>, but set in morocco instead of gold or
silver, and there are many others who are working well and
earnestly at art binding with delicate skill and taste. Outside
the inner circle of professional bookbinders there has grown
up a new profession, that of the designer for pictorial book-covers,
especially those intended to be shown in colour on cloth
or paper. Among notable designers may be mentioned Lewis
F. Day, A.A. Turbayne, Walter Crane and Charles Ricketts.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Machine-binding</i>.&mdash;The principal types of machine for commercial
binding are described below. They are almost all due to American
or German ingenuity. It may be noted that, while books sewn by
hand on bands have the loose ends of the bands actually drawn
through the boards and strongly fastened to them through their
substance, no machines for covering sewn books will do this so
effectively. All they will do as a rule is to paste down to the inner
surfaces of the boards the loose ends of the tapes on which the
sewing is done. So that, although it may last a long time if not
much used, a &ldquo;cased&rdquo; book is likely to slip out of its cover as soon
as the paste fixing it perishes. Modern bookbinding machines of all
kinds are usually driven by power, and in consequence of the necessary
setting of most of them accurately to some particular size of
book, they are not suitable for binding books of different sizes; the
full advantage of them can only be taken where there is a large
edition of one book.</p>

<p>Book-sewing machines (fig. 9) are of two kinds one sews the books
on bands, either flat or round, and the other supplies the place of
bands by a kind of chain stitch. The band-working
machines bring the return thread back by pulling it
<span class="sidenote">Sewing.</span>
through the upper and lower edges of the back of each section, thereby
to some extent weakening each section, but at the same time
this weakening can be to some extent neutralized by careful head-banding.
The other system, where the band is replaced by a chain
stitch, brings back the return thread inside each section; the objection
to this is that there is a flattening out of the back of the book,
which becomes a difficulty when the subsequent operation of covering
the book begins. The sections are sewn continuously in a long
line, and are afterwards cut apart. The threads catch into hooked
needles and are drawn through holes made by piercers set to a certain
distance; a shuttle like that used in an ordinary sewing-machine
sews the inner thread backwards and forwards. Each section is
placed upon a sort of metal saddle by the hand of the operator, one
after the other, the machine working continuously unless the action
is cut off or controlled by a foot-lever or pedal. This machine is
much quieter to work, and although the inner threads are too bulky
to be quite satisfactory, this is not a serious matter like the cutting
of the upper and lower edges of the back already described, and,
moreover, is probably capable of being either improved away or so
minimized that it will become of small importance.</p>

<p>The Martini book-sewing machine, which sews books on tape
without cutting up head or tail&mdash;a most important improvement&mdash;
and also forms complete Kettle stitches, will sew books of any size
up to 18 in. The needles are straight, and the necessary adjustments
for various sizes of books are very simple.</p>

<p>The machine for rounding and backing sewn books requires a
rather elaborate and very careful setting of several parts to the
exact requirement of each size to be worked. The sewn
book with the back glued is caught in a clip and forced between
<span class="sidenote">Rounding and backing.</span>
two tight rollers, the result being that the hitherto
flat back is automatically turned into a rounded shape
(figs. 10 and 11). The book is then drawn forward, by a continuance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>
of the onward movement, until it reaches the rounding plate, which
is a block of steel with a polished groove a little larger than the size
required. This rounding plate moves within a small arc by means
of heavy counter-weights, and on the back of the book being strongly
pressed against it, it receives the permanent form of the groove cut
in it, at the same time a strong grip on each side of the book causes
the ledge to rise up along each outer edge of the back. This ledge it
is which enables the boards to be subsequently fixed in such a way
as to hinge on a line outside the actual and natural boundary of the
book. Before the discovery of the possibility of producing this ledge,
the boards of books hinged upon a line coincident with the inner
edges of the back, the result of which was that when the book was
opened there was an invariable tendency to open and pull away the
few outer sections of the paper or vellum itself&mdash;a destructive and
disagreeable peculiarity. These machines are capable, after they
are properly set, of rounding and backing about 750 volumes of the
same size within an hour.</p>

<p>The machine for making cases, or &ldquo;case&rdquo; covers (fig. 12), for books
is large and complicated, but beautifully effective. It contains altogether
over fifty springs, some of which are very small, like watch
fittings, while others are large and powerful. The machine is fed
with pieces of cardboard cut exactly to the sizes of the required
boards, other pieces cut to the size of the back, and a long roll of the
cloth with which the cases are to be covered, and when set working
the roll of cloth is gradually unwound and glued by contact with a
roller, which is drawn along until it reaches a point where the two
boards are ingeniously dropped upon it one by one, then on again
to where a long arm swings backwards and forwards, at each movement
picking up a piece of cardboard for the back and placing it
gently exactly upon the glued bed left for it between the two boards
already fixed. Next, as the cloth passes along, it comes under the
sharp influence of two rectangular gouges which cut out the corners,
the remaining side pieces being gradually but irresistibly turned up
by hollow raisers and flattened down by small rollers, a very delicate
piece of machinery finishing the corners in a masterly way. Then,
lastly, an arrangement of raisers and rollers acting at right angles
to the last mentioned turn over and press out the remaining pieces
of cloth. Of course each piece of cloth is cut across at the proper
point before the turning up begins. This machine is capable of
producing 1200 cases in an hour of any size that the machine will
take.</p>

<p class="pt2">The Smyth casing-in machine (fig. 13) pastes the sides of a book
as required and then attaches the cover over all. Cleverly arranged
rollers catch the book, and by a carefully regulated pressure fix the
cover in the proper position. There is a &ldquo;jointing-in&rdquo; device which
at a critical moment forces the joints in the cover into the joints
in the book. It will work books from 4 to 22 in. in length and from
¼ to 3 in. in thickness, and can cover from 10 to 15 books per minute.</p>

<p>Here may also be mentioned the Sheridan wrappering machine,
which covers magazines and pamphlets ranging from 5 to 12 in.
in length at the rate of 40 a minute.</p>

<p>Wiring is a cheap method of keeping together thin parts of periodicals
or tracts. The machine that executes it is simple in construction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>221</span>
and use. It drives a short wire pin, bent at right angles at each end,
<span class="sidenote">Wiring.</span>
through the folds of the sections of a book or through the entire
thickness, sideways, after the manner of stabbing. The
projecting ends, when through the substance of the paper,
are bent over and flattened so as to grip firmly. The metal used for
these pins was at first very liable to rust, and consequently did
much damage to the paper near it, but this defect has now been
largely remedied. At the same time the principle of using hard
metal wire instead of flexible hempen thread is essentially vicious,
and should only be used as a temporary expedient for publications
of little value.</p>

<p>The machines (fig. 14) now used for blocking designs upon book-covers
are practically the same as have been employed for many
years. Several small improvements have been introduced
as to better inking of the rollers for colour work, and
<span class="sidenote">Blocking.</span>
better heating of the blocks used for gold work. A blocking press
is now, in consequence of the size of many of the blocks, a large
and cumbersome machine. The block itself is fixed firmly in a
strong metal bed, and a movable table in front of it is fitted with
gauges which keep the cover exactly in its right place. For gold
work the block is kept at the proper temperature by means of gas
jets, and the cover being properly overlaid with gold leaf is passed,
on its table, directly under the block and then pressed steadily
upwards against it, lowered, drawn out, and the superfluous gold
rubbed off. The same process is followed in the case of colour
blocks, only now the block need not be heated, but is inked by
means of a roller for each impression. A separate printing is necessary
for each colour. These printings always require great care on
the part of the operator, who has to watch the working of each pull
very carefully, and if any readjustment is wanted, to make it at
once, so that it is difficult to estimate at what rate they can be
made. In the matter of gold blocking there must be great care
exercised in the matter of the heat of the block, for if it is too hot
the gold will adhere where it is not wanted, and if too cool it will
not adhere where it is required. Great nicety is also necessary as
to the exact pressure required as well as the precise number of
moments during which the block should be in contact with the gold,
which is fastened to the cloth or leather by means of the solidification
by heat of egg albumen. Blocking presses are mainly of German
make, but Scottish and English presses are also largely used.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOOKCASE,<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> an article of furniture, forming a shelved receptacle,
usually perpendicular or horizontal, for the storage of
books. When books, being written by hand, were excessively
scarce, they were kept in small coffers which the great carried about
with them on their journeys. As manuscript volumes accumulated
in the religious houses or in regal palaces, they were stored upon
shelves or in cupboards, and it is from these cupboards that the
bookcase of to-day directly descends. At a somewhat later date
the doors were, for convenience&rsquo; sake, discarded, and the evolution
of the bookcase made one step forward. Even then, however,
the volumes were not arranged in the modern fashion. They
were either placed in piles upon their sides, or if upright, were
ranged with their backs to the wall and their edges outwards.
The band of leather, vellum or parchment which closed the
book was often used for the inscription of the title, which was
thus on the fore-edge instead of on the back. It was not until the
invention of printing had greatly cheapened books that it became
the practice to write the title on the back and place the edges
inwards. Early bookcases were usually of oak, which is still
deemed to be the most appropriate wood for a stately library.
The oldest bookcases in England are those in the Bodleian library
at Oxford, which were placed in position in the last year or two
of the 16th century; in that library are the earliest extant
examples of shelved galleries over the flat wall-cases. Long
ranges of book-shelves are necessarily somewhat severe in
appearance, and many attempts have been made by means
of carved cornices and pilasters to give them a more <i>riant</i>
appearance&mdash;attempts which were never so successful as in the
hands of the great English cabinet-makers of the second half of
the 18th century.</p>

<p>Both Chippendale and Sheraton made or designed great
numbers of bookcases, mostly glazed with little lozenges encased
in fret-work frames often of great charm and elegance. The
alluring grace of some of Sheraton&rsquo;s satinwood bookcases
has very rarely indeed been equalled. The French cabinet-makers
of the same period were also highly successful with small
ornamental cases. Mahogany, rosewood, satinwood and even
choicer exotic timbers were used; they were often inlaid with
marqueterie and mounted with chased and gilded bronze.
Dwarf bookcases were frequently finished with a slab of choice
marble at the top. In the great public libraries of the 20th
century the bookcases are often of iron, as in the British Museum
where the shelves are covered with cowhide, of steel, as in the
library of Congress at Washington, or of slate, as in the Fitzwilliam
library at Cambridge. There are three systems of
arranging bookcases&mdash;flat against the wall; in &ldquo;stacks&rdquo; or
ranges parallel to each other with merely enough space between
to allow of the passage of a librarian; or in bays or alcoves where
cases jut out into the room at right angles to the wall-cases.
The stack system is suitable only for public libraries where
economy of space is essential; the bay system is not only handsome
but utilizes the space to great advantage. The library of
the city of London at the Guildhall is a peculiarly effective
example of the bay arrangement.</p>

<p>The whole question of the construction and arrangement of bookcases
was learnedly discussed in the light of experience by W.E.
Gladstone in the Nineteenth Century for March 1890.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOOK-COLLECTING,<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span> the bringing together of books which
in their contents, their form or the history of the individual
copy possess some element of permanent interest, and either
actually or prospectively are rare, in the sense of being difficult
to procure. This qualification of rarity, which figures much too
largely in the popular view of book-collecting, is entirely subordinate
to that of interest, for the rarity of a book devoid of
interest is a matter of no concern. On the other hand so long as
a book (or anything else) is and appears likely to continue to be
easily procurable at any moment, no one has any reason for collecting
it. The anticipation that it will always be easily procurable is
often unfounded; but so long as the anticipation exists it restrains
collecting, with the result that Horn-books are much rarer than
First Folio Shakespeares. It has even been laid down that
the ultimate rarity of books varies in the inverse ratio of the
number of copies originally printed, and though the generalization
is a little sweeping, it is not far from the truth. To triumph
over small difficulties being the chief element in games of skill, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>222</span>
different varieties of book-collecting, which offer almost as many
varieties of grades of difficulty, make excellent hobbies. But
in its essence the pastime of a book-collector is identical with the
official work of the curator of a museum, and thus also with one
branch of the duties of the librarian of any library of respectable
age. In its inception every library is a literary workshop, with
more or less of a garden or recreation ground attached according
as its managers are influenced by the humanities or by a narrow
conception of utility. As the library grows, the books and
editions which have been the tools of one generation pass out of
use; and it becomes largely a depository or storehouse of a stock
much of which is dead. But from out of this seemingly dead
stock preserved at haphazard, critics and antiquaries gradually
pick out books which they find to be still alive. Of some of
these the interest cannot be reproduced in its entirety by any mere
reprint, and it is this salvage which forms the literary museum.
Book-collectors are privileged to leap at once to this stage in
their relations with books, using the dealers&rsquo; shops and catalogues
as depositories from which to pick the books which will best fit
with the aim or central idea of their collection. For in the
modern private collection, as in the modern museum, the need for
a central idea must be fully recognized. Neither the collector nor
the curator can be content to keep a mere curiosity-shop. It is
the collector&rsquo;s business to illustrate his central idea by his
choice of examples, by the care with which he describes them and
the skill with which they are arranged. In all these matters many
amateurs rival, if they do not outstrip, the professional curators
and librarians, and not seldom their collections are made with a
view to their ultimate transference to public ownership. In any
case it is by the zeal of collectors that books which otherwise
would have perished from neglect are discovered, cared for and
preserved, and those who achieve these results certainly deserve
well of the community.</p>

<p>Whenever a high degree of civilization has been attained
book-lovers have multiplied, and to the student with his modest
desire to read his favourite author in a well-written or
well-printed copy there has been added a class of
<span class="sidenote">History.</span>
owners suspected of caring more for the externals of books than
for the enjoyment to be obtained by reading them. But although
adumbrations of it existed under the Roman empire and towards
the end of the middle ages, book-collecting, as it is now understood,
is essentially of modern growth. A glance through what
must be regarded as the medieval text-book on the love of books,
the <i>Philobiblon</i>, attributed to Richard de Bury (written in 1345),
shows that it deals almost exclusively with the delights of literature,
and Sebastian Brant&rsquo;s attack on the book-fool, written a
century and a half later, demonstrates nothing more than that
the possession of books is a poor substitute for learning. This
is so obviously true that before book-collecting in the modern
sense can begin it is essential that there should be no lack of
books to read, just as until cups and saucers became plentiful
there was no room for the collector of old china. Even when
the invention of printing had reduced the cost of books by some
80%, book-collectors did not immediately appear. There is
a natural temptation to imagine that the early book-owners,
whose libraries have enriched modern collectors with some of
their best-known treasures, must necessarily have been collectors
themselves. This is far from being the case. Hardly a book
of all that Jean Grolier (1479-1565) caused to be bound so tastefully
for himself and his friends reveals any antiquarian instincts
in its liberal owner, who bought partly to encourage the best
printers of his day, partly to provide his friends with the most
recent fruits of Renaissance scholarship. In England Archbishop
Cranmer, Lords Arundel and Lumley, and Henry, prince
of Wales (1594-1612), in France the famous historian Jacques
Auguste de Thou (1553-1617), brought together the best books
of their day in all departments of learned literature, put them
into handsome leather jackets, and enriched them with their
coats of arms, heraldic badges or other marks of possession.
But they brought their books together for use and study, to be
read by themselves and by the scholars who frequented their
houses, and no evidence has been produced that they appreciated
what a collector might now call the points of a book other than
its fine condition and literary or informational merits. Again,
not a few other more or less famous men have been dubbed collectors
on the score of a scanty shelf-full of volumes known to
have been stamped with their arms. Collecting, as distinct both
from the formation of working libraries and from casual ownership
of this latter kind, may perhaps be said to have begun in England
at the time of the antiquarian reaction produced by the book-massacres
when the monasteries were dissolved by Henry VIII.,
and the university and college libraries and the parish service
books were plundered and stript by the commissioners of Edward
VI. To rescue good books from perishing is one of the main
objects of book-collecting, and when Archbishop Parker and Sir
Robert Cotton set to work to gather what they could of the
scattered records of English statecraft and literature, and of the
decorative art bestowed so lavishly on the books of public and
private devotion, they were book-collectors in a sense and on a
scale to which few of their modern imitators can pretend. Men
of more slender purses, and armed with none of Archbishop
Parker&rsquo;s special powers, worked according to their ability on
similar lines. Humphrey Dyson, an Elizabethan notary, who
collected contemporary proclamations and books from the early
English presses, and George Thomason (d. 1666), the bookseller
who bought, stored and catalogued all the pamphlet literature
of the Civil War, were mindful of the future historians of the days
in which they lived. By the end of the 17th century book-collecting
was in full swing all over Europe, and much of its apparatus
had come into existence. In 1676 book auctions were introduced
into England from Holland, and soon we can trace in priced catalogues
the beginning of a taste for Caxtons, and the books prized
by collectors slowly fought their way up from amid the heavy
volumes of theology by which they were at first overwhelmed.</p>

<p>While book-collecting thus came into existence it was rather
as an added grace in the formation of a fine library than as a
separate pursuit. Almost all the large book-buyers of the 16th,
17th and 18th centuries bought with a public object, or were
rewarded for their zeal by their treasures being thought worthy
of a public resting-place. Sir Thomas Smith (d. 1577) bequeathed
his books to Queens&rsquo; College, Cambridge; Archbishop Parker&rsquo;s
were left under severe restrictions to Corpus Christi College in
the same university; Sir Thomas Bodley refounded during his
lifetime the university library at Oxford, to which also Laud
gave liberally and Selden bequeathed his books. The library
of Archbishop Williams went to St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge;
that of Archbishop Usher was bought for Trinity College, Dublin.
The mathematical and scientific books of Thomas Howard, earl
of Norfolk (d. 1646), were given by his grandson to the Royal
Society; the heraldic collections of Ralph Sheldon (d. 1684) to
Heralds&rsquo; College; the library in which Pepys took so much
pleasure to Magdalene College, Cambridge. Bishop Moore&rsquo;s books,
including a little volume of Caxton quartos, almost all unique,
were bought by George I. and presented to the university library
at Cambridge. Archbishop Marsh, who had previously bought
Stillingfleet&rsquo;s printed books (his manuscripts went to Oxford),
founded a library at Dublin. The immense accumulations of
Thomas Rawlinson (d. 1725) provided materials for a series of
auctions, and Harley&rsquo;s printed books were sold to Osbourne the
bookseller. But the trend was all towards public ownership.
While Richard Rawlinson (d. 1755) allowed his brother&rsquo;s books to
be sold, the best of his own were bequeathed to Oxford, and the
Harleian MSS. were offered to the nation at a sum far below
their value. A similar offer of the great collections formed by
Sir Hans Sloane, including some 50,000 printed books, together
with the need for taking better care of what remained of the
Cotton manuscripts, vested in trustees for public use in 1702 and
partially destroyed by fire in 1731, led to the foundation of the
British Museum in 1753, and this on its opening in 1757 was
almost immediately enriched by George II.&rsquo;s gift of the old
royal library, formed by the kings and queens of England from
Henry VII. to Charles II., and by Henry, prince of Wales, son
of James I., who had bought the books belonging to Archbishop
Cranmer and Lords Arundel and Lumley. A few notable book-buyers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span>
could not afford to bequeath their treasures to libraries,
<i>e.g.</i> Richard Smith, the secondary of the Poultry Compter
(d. 1675), at whose book-sale (1682) a dozen Caxtons sold for
from 2 S. to 18 S. apiece, Dr Francis Bernard (d. 1698), Narcissus
Luttrell(d. 1732) and Dr Richard Mead (d. 1754). At the opposite
end of the scale, in the earls of Sunderland (d. 1722) and Pembroke
(d. 1733), we have early examples of the attempts, seldom
successful, of book-loving peers to make their libraries into
permanent heirlooms. But as has been said, the drift up to
1760 was all towards public ownership, and the libraries were for
the most part general in character, though the interest in typographical
antiquities was already well marked.</p>

<p>When George III. came to the throne he found himself bookless,
and the magnificent library of over 80,000 books and pamphlets
and 440 manuscripts which he accumulated shows on a large
scale the catholic and literary spirit of the book-lovers of his day.
As befitted the library of an English king it was rich in English
classics as well as in those of Greece and Rome, and the typographical
first-fruits of Mainz, Rome and Venice were balanced
by numerous works from the first presses of Westminster, London
and Oxford. This noble library passed in 1823 to the British
Museum, which had already received the much smaller but carefully
chosen collection of the Rev. C.M. Cracherode (d. 1799), and
in 1846 was further enriched by the wonderful library formed by
Thomas Grenville, the last of its great book-loving benefactors, who
died in that year, aged ninety-one. A few less wealthy men had
kept up the old public-spirited tradition during George III.&rsquo;s reign,
Garrick bequeathing his fine collection of English plays and Sir
Joseph Banks his natural history books to the British Museum,
while Capell&rsquo;s Shakespearian treasures enriched Trinity College,
Cambridge, and those of Malone went to the Bodleian library at
Oxford, the formation of these special collections, in place of the
large general library with a sprinkling of rarities, being in itself
worth noting. But the noble book-buyers celebrated by the Rev.
Thomas Frognall Dibdin in his numerous bibliographical works
kept mainly on the old lines, though with aims less patriotic than
their predecessors. The duke of Roxburghe&rsquo;s books were sold
in 1812, and the excitement produced by the auction, more
especially by the competition between Lord Spencer and the
duke of Marlborough (at that time marquess of Blandford) for an
edition of Boccaccio printed by Valdarfer at Venice in 1471, led
to the formation of the Roxburghe Club at a commemorative
dinner. In 1819 the duke of Marlborough&rsquo;s books were sold, and
the Boccaccio for which he had paid £2260 went to Earl Spencer
(d. 1834) for £750, to pass with the rest of his rare books to Mrs
Rylands in 1892, and by her gift to the John Rylands library
at Manchester in 1899. The books of Sir M.M. Sykes were sold
in 1824, those of J.B. Inglis in 1826 (after which he collected again)
and those of George Hibbert in 1829. The 150,000 volumes brought
together by Richard Heber at an expense of about £100,000 were
disposed of by successive sales during the years 1834-1837 and
realized not much more than half their cost. The wonderful library
of William Beckford (d. 1844), especially rich in fine bindings, bequeathed
to his daughter, the duchess of Hamilton, was sold in 1882,
with the Hamilton manuscripts, for the most part to the German
government. Their dispersal was preceded in 1881 by that
of the Sunderland collection, already mentioned. The
library of Brian Fairfax (d. 1749), which had passed to the earls
of Jersey, was sold in 1885, that of Sir John Thorold (d. 1815)
in 1884, his &ldquo;Gutenberg&rdquo; Bible fetching £3900 and his Mainz
Psalter £4950. The great collection of manuscripts formed by Sir
Thomas Phillipps (d. 1872) has furnished materials for numerous
sales. The printed books of the earl of Ashburnham (d. 1878)
kept the auctioneers busy in 1897 and 1898; his manuscripts
were sold, some to the British government (the Stowe collection
shared between the British Museum and Dublin), the German
government (part of the Libri and Barrois collection, all,
save one MS. of 13th century German ballads, resold to France),
the Italian government (the rest of the Libri collection)
Mr Yates Thompson (the MSS. known as the Appendix) and
Mr J. Pierpont Morgan (the Lindau Gospels). The collections
formed by Mr W.H. Miller (d. 1848, mainly English poetry), the
duke of Devonshire (d. 1858) and Mr Henry Huth (d. 1878),
are still intact.</p>

<p>Among the book-buyers of the reign of George III., John
Ratcliffe, an ex-coal-merchant, and James West had devoted
themselves specially to Caxtons (of which the former possessed
48 and the latter 34) and the products of other early English
presses. The collections of Capell and Garrick were also small
and homogeneous. Each section, moreover, of some of the great
libraries that have just been enumerated might fairly be considered
a collection in itself, the union of several collections in the
same library being made possible by the wealth of their purchaser
and the small prices fetched by most classes of books in comparison
with those which are now paid. But perhaps the modern
cabinet theory of book-collecting was first carried out with
conspicuous skill by Henry Perkins (d. 1855), whose 865 fine
manuscripts and specimens of early printing, when sold in 1870,
realized nearly £26,000. If surrounded by a sufficient quantity
of general literature the collection might not have seemed
noticeably different from some of those already mentioned, but
the growing cost of books, together with difficulties as to house-room,
combined to discourage miscellaneous buying on a large
scale, and what has been called the &ldquo;cabinet&rdquo; theory of collecting,
so well carried out by Henry Perkins, became increasingly
popular among book buyers, alike in France, England and the
United States of America. Henri Béraldi, in his catalogue of his
own collection (printed 1892), has described how in France a little
band of book-loving amateurs grew up who laughed at the
<i>bibliophile de la vieille roche</i> as they disrespectfully called their
predecessors, and prided themselves on the unity and compactness
of their own treasures. In place of the miscellaneous
library in which every class of book claimed to be represented,
and which needed a special room or gallery to house it, they aimed
at small collections which should epitomize the owner&rsquo;s tastes and
require nothing bulkier than a neat bookcase or cabinet to hold
them. The French bibliophiles whom M. Béraldi celebrated
applied this theory with great success to collecting the dainty
French illustrated books of the 18th century which were their
especial favourites. In England Richard Fisher treated his
fine examples of early book-illustration as part of his collection
of engravings, etchings and woodcuts  (illustrated catalogue printed
1879), and Frederick Locker (Locker-Lampson) formed in two
small bookcases such a gathering of first editions of English imaginative
literature that the mere catalogue of it (printed in 1886)
produced the effect of a stately and picturesque procession. Some
of the book-hoards of previous generations could have spared the
equivalent of the Locker collection without seeming noticeably
the poorer, but the compactness and unity of this small collection,
in which every book appears to have been bought for a special
reason and to form an integral part of the whole, gave it an artistic
individuality which was a pleasant triumph for its owner, and
excited so much interest among American admirers of Mr
Locker&rsquo;s poetry that it may be said to have set a fashion. As
another example of the value of a small collection, both for
delight and for historical and artistic study, mention may be
made of the little roomful of manuscripts and incunabula which
William Morris brought together to illustrate the history of the
bookish arts in the middle ages before the Renaissance introduced
new ideals. Many living collectors are working in a similar spirit,
and as this spirit spreads the monotony of the old libraries, in
which the same editions of the same books recurred with wearisome
frequency, should be replaced by much greater individuality
and variety. Moreover, if they can be grouped round some
central idea cheap books may yield just as good sport to the
collector as expensive ones, and the collector of quite modern
works may render admirable service to posterity. The only
limitation is against books specially manufactured to attract him,
or artificially made rare. A quite wholesome interest in contemporary
first editions was brought to nought about 1889 by the
booksellers beginning to hoard copies of Browning&rsquo;s <i>Asolando</i>
and Mr Lang&rsquo;s <i>Blue Fairy Book</i> on the day of publication, while
a graceful but quite minor poet was made ridiculous by £100
being asked for a set of his privately printed <i>opuscula</i>. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>224</span>
petty gambling in books printed at the Kelmscott and Doves&rsquo;
presses, and in the fine paper copies of a certain <i>Life of Queen
Victoria</i>, for which a premium of 250% was asked before publication,
is another proof that until the manufacturing stage is
over collecting cannot safely begin. But with this exception
the field is open, and the 19th century offers as good a hunting
ground as any of its predecessors.</p>

<p>While book-collecting may thus take an endless variety of
forms the heads under which these may be grouped are few and
fairly easily defined. They may be here briefly indicated
together with some notes as to the literature
<span class="sidenote">Objects and methods.</span>
which has grown up round them. The development
which bibliographical literature has taken is indeed
very significant of the changed ideals of collectors. Brunet&rsquo;s
<i>Manuel du libraire</i>, first published in 1810, attained its fifth
edition in 1860-1864, and has never since been re-edited (supplement,
1878-1880). The <i>Bibliographer&rsquo;s Manual of English
Literature</i> by W.T. Lowndes, first published in 1834, was revised
by H.G. Bohn in 1857-1864, and of this also no further edition
has been printed. These two works between them gave all the
information the old-fashioned collectors required, the <i>Trésor de
livres rares et précieux</i> by J.G.T. Graesse (Dresden, 1859-1867,
supplementary volume in 1869) adding little to the information
given by Brunet. The day of the omnivorous collector being
past, the place of these general manuals has been taken by
more detailed bibliographies and handbooks on special books,
and though new editions of both Lowndes and Brunet would
be useful to librarians and booksellers no publisher has had the
courage to produce them.</p>

<p>To attract a collector a book must appeal to his eye, his mind
or his imagination, and many famous books appeal to all three.
A book may be beautiful by virtue of its binding, its illustrations
or the simple perfection and harmony of its print and paper.
The attraction of a fine binding has always been felt in France,
the high prices quoted for Elzevirs and French first editions being
often due much more to their 17th and 18th century jackets than
to the books themselves. The appreciation of old bindings has
greatly increased in England since the exhibition of them at the
Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1891 (illustrated catalogue printed
the same year), English blind stamped bindings, embroidered
bindings, and bindings attributable to Samuel Mearne (<i>temp.</i>
Charles II.) being much more sought after than formerly.
(See <span class="sc"><a href="#ar131">Bookbinding</a></span>.)</p>

<p>Illustrated books of certain periods are also much in request,
and with the exception of a few which early celebrity has prevented
becoming rare have increased inordinately in price.
The primitive woodcuts in incunabula are now almost too highly
appreciated, and while the <i>Nuremburg Chronicle</i> (1493) seldom
fetches more than £30 or the <i>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</i> (Venice,
1499) more than £120, rarer books are priced in hundreds. The
best books on the subject are: for Italy, Lippmann&rsquo;s <i>Wood Engraving
in Italy in the 15th Century</i> (1888), Kristeller&rsquo;s <i>Early Florentine
Woodcuts</i> (1897), the duc de Rivoli&rsquo;s (Prince d&rsquo;Essling&rsquo;s)
<i>Bibliographie des livres à figures vénitiens 1469-1525</i> (1892,
new edition 1906); for Germany, Muther&rsquo;s <i>Die deutsche
Bücherillustration der Gothik und Frührenaissance</i> (1884); for
Holland and Belgium, Sir W.M. Conway&rsquo;s <i>The Woodcutters
of the Netherlands in the 15th Century</i> (1884); for France the
material will all be found in Claudin&rsquo;s <i>Histoire de l&rsquo;imprimerie
en France</i> (1900, &amp;c.). Some information on the illustrated books
of the early 16th century is given in Butsch&rsquo;s <i>Die Bücherornamentik
der Renaissance</i> (1878), but the pretty French books of
the middle of the century and the later Dutch and English copper-engraved
book illustrations (for the latter see Colvin&rsquo;s <i>Early
Engraving and Engravers in England</i>, 1905) have been imperfectly
appreciated. This cannot be said of the French books of the 18th
century chronicled by H. Cohen, <i>Guide de l&rsquo;amateur de livre
à gravures du XVIII<span class="sp">e</span> siècle</i> (5th ed., 1886), much of the same
information, with a little more about English books, being
given in Lewine&rsquo;s <i>Bibliography of Eighteenth Century Art and
Illustrated Books</i> (1898). English books with coloured illustrations,
for which there has arisen a sudden fashion, are well
described in Martin Hardie&rsquo;s <i>English Colour Books</i> (1906).
Bewick&rsquo;s work has been described by Mr Austin Dobson.</p>

<p>Appreciation of finely printed books has seldom extended much
beyond the 15th century. In addition to the works mentioned
in the article on incunabula(<i>q.v.</i>), note may be made of Humphrey&rsquo;s
<i>Masterpieces of the Early Printers and Engravers</i> (1870), while
Lippmann&rsquo;s <i>Druckschriften des XV. bis XVIII Jahrhunderts</i>
(1884-1887) covers, though not very fully, the later period.</p>

<p>Among books which make an intellectual appeal to the collectors
may be classed all works of historical value which have
not been reprinted, or of which the original editions are more
authentic, or convincing, than modern reprints. It is evident that
these cover a vast field, and that the collector in taking possession
of any corner of it is at once the servant and rival of historical
students. Lord Crawford&rsquo;s vast collections of English, Scottish
and Irish proclamations and of papal bulls may be cited as
capital instances of the work which a collector may do for the
promotion of historical research, and the philological library
brought together by Prince Lucien Bonaparte (<i>An Attempt
at a Catalogue</i> by V. Collins, published 1894) and the Foxwell
collection of early books on political economy (presented to the
university of London by the Goldsmiths&rsquo; Company) are two
other instances of recent date. Much collecting of this kind is
now being carried on by the libraries of institutes and societies
connected with special professions and studies, but there is ample
room also for private collectors to work on these lines.</p>

<p>Of books which appeal to a collector&rsquo;s imagination the most
obvious examples are those which can be associated with some
famous person or event. A book which has belonged to a king
or queen (more especially one who, like Mary queen of Scots,
has appealed to popular sympathies), or to a great statesman,
soldier or poet, which bears any mark of having been valued by
him, or of being connected with any striking incident in his life,
has an interest which defies analysis. Collectors themselves
have a natural tenderness for their predecessors, and a copy of
a famous work is all the more regarded if its pedigree can be
traced through a long series of book-loving owners. Hence the
production of such works as <i>Great Book-Collectors</i> by Charles
and Mary Elton (1893), <i>English Book-Collectors</i> by W.Y. Fletcher
(1902) and Guigard&rsquo;s <i>Nouvel armorial du bibliophile</i> (1890).
Books condemned to be burnt, or which have caused the persecution
of their authors, have an imaginative interest of another
kind, though one which seems to have appealed more to writers
of books than to collectors. As has already been noted, most of
the books specially valued by collectors make a double or triple
appeal to the collecting instinct, and the desire to possess first
editions may be accounted for partly by their positive superiority
over reprints for purposes of study, partly by the associations
which they can be proved to possess or which imagination creates
for them. The value set on them is at least to some extent
fanciful. It would be difficult, for instance, to justify the high
prices paid by collectors of the days of George III. for the first
printed editions of the Greek and Latin classics. With few
exceptions these are of no value as texts, and there are no possible
associations by which they can be linked with the personality
of their authors. It may be doubted whether any one now
collects them save as specimens of printing, though no class of
books which has once been prized ever sinks back into absolute
obscurity. On the other hand the prestige of the first editions
of English and French literary masterpieces has immensely
increased. A first folio Shakespeare (1623) was in 1906 sold
separately for £3000, and the MacGeorge copies of the first four
folios (1623, 1632, 1663-1664 and 1685) fetched collectively the
high price of £10,000. The quarto editions of Shakespeare plays
have appreciated even more, several of these little books, once
sold at 6d. apiece, having fetched over £1000, while the unknown
and unique copy of the 1594 edition of <i>Titus Andronicus</i>,
discovered in Sweden, speedily passed to an American collector
for £2000. Information as to early editions of famous English
books will be found in Lowndes&rsquo; <i>Bibliographer&rsquo;s Manual</i>, in
Hazlitt&rsquo;s <i>Handbook to the Popular Poetical and Dramatic Literature
of Great Britain from the Invention of Printing to the Restoration</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>
(1867) and his subsequent <i>Collections and Notes</i> (1876-1903),
and as to more recent books in Slater&rsquo;s <i>Early Editions, a
bibliographical survey of the works of some popular modern authors</i>
(1894), while French classics have found an excellent chronicler
in Jules Le Petit (<i>Bibliographie des principales éditions originales
d&rsquo;ècrivains français du XV<span class="sp">e</span> au XVIII<span class="sp">e</span> siècle</i>, 1888).</p>

<p>In most cases there is a marked falling off in the interest with
which early editions other than the first are regarded, and consequently
in the prices paid for them, though important changes
in the text give to the edition in which they first occur some
shadow of the prestige attaching to an original issue. One of
the recognized byways of book-collecting, however, used to be
the collection of as many editions as possible of the same work.
When this result in the acquisition of numerous late editions of
no value for the text its only usefulness would appear to be the
index it may offer to the author&rsquo;s popularity. But in translations
of the Bible, in liturgical works, and in editions published during the
author&rsquo;s life the aid offered to the study of the development of the
final text by a long row of intermediate editions may be very great.</p>

<p>Another instance in which imagination reinforces the more positive
interest a book may possess is in the case of editions which
can be connected with the origin, diffusion or development of
printing. Piety suggests that book-lovers should take a special
interest in the history of the art which has done so much for their
happiness, and in this respect they have mostly shown themselves
religious. The first book printed in any town is reasonably
coveted by local antiquaries, and the desire to measure the
amount and quality of the work of every early printer has caused
the preservation of thousands of books which would otherwise
have perished. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Incunabula</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The financial side of book-collecting may be studied in Slater&rsquo;s
<i>Book-Prices Current</i>, published annually since 1887, and in
Livingston&rsquo;s <i>American Book Prices Current</i>, and in the same
author&rsquo;s <i>Auction Prices of Books</i> (1905). While largely influenced
by fashion the prices given for books are never wholly unreasonable.
They are determined, firstly by the positive or associative
interest which can be found in the book itself, secondly by the
infrequency with which copies come into the market compared
with the number and wealth of their would-be possessors, and
thirdly, except in the case of books of the greatest interest and
rarity, by the condition of the copy offered in respect to completeness,
size, freshness and absence of stains.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOOK-KEEPING,<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span> a systematic record of business transactions,
in a form conveniently available for reference, made by individuals
or corporations engaged in commercial or financial operations
with a view to enabling them with the minimum amount
of trouble and of dislocation to the business itself to ascertain at
any time (1) the detailed particulars of the transactions undertaken,
and (2) the cumulative effect upon the business and its
financial relations to others. Book-keeping, sometimes described
as a science and sometimes as an art, partakes of the nature of
both. It is not so much a discovery as a growth, the crude
methods of former days having been gradually improved to
meet the changing requirements of business, and this process
of evolution is still going on. The ideal of any system of
book-keeping is the maximum of record combined with the minimum
of labour, but as dishonesty has to be guarded against, no system
of book-keeping can be regarded as adequate which does not
enable the record to be readily verified as a true and complete
statement of the transactions involved. Such a verification is
called an audit, and in the case of public and other large concerns
is ordinarily undertaken by professional accountants (<i>q.v.</i>).
Where the book-keeping staff is large it is usually organized so
that its members, to some extent at least, check each other&rsquo;s
work, and to that extent an audit, known as a &ldquo;staff audit&rdquo;
or &ldquo;internal check,&rdquo; is frequently performed by the book-keeping
staff itself.</p>

<p>Formerly, when credit was a considerably less important
factor than now in commercial transactions, book-keeping was
frequently limited to an account of receipts and payments of
money; and in early times, before money was in use, to an account
of the receipt and issue of goods of different kinds. Even now
what may be called the &ldquo;cash system&rdquo; of accounts is almost
exclusively used by governments, local authorities, and charitable
and other institutions; but in business it is equally necessary
to record movements of credit, as a mere statement of receipts
and payments of money would show only a part of the total
number of transactions undertaken. As for practical purposes
some limit must be placed upon the daily record of transactions,
certain classes show only a record of cash receipts
and payments, which must, when it is desired to ascertain the
actual position of affairs, be adjusted by bringing into account
those transactions which have not yet been completed by the
receipt or payment of money. For instance, it is usual to charge
customers with goods sold to them at the date when the sale
takes place, and to give them credit for the amount received in
payment upon the date of receipt (thus completely recording
every phase of the transaction as and when it occurs); but in
connexion (say) with wages it is not usual to give each workman
credit for the services rendered by him from day to day, but
merely to charge up the amounts, when paid, to a wages account,
which thus at any date only shows the amounts which have
actually been paid, and takes no cognisance of the sums accruing
due. When, therefore, it is desired to ascertain the actual
expenditure upon wages for any given period, it is necessary to
allow for the payments made during that period in respect of
work previously performed, and to add the value of work
performed during the current period which remains unpaid.
In the majority of businesses those accounts which deal with
various forms of standing expenses are thus dealt with, and in
consequence the record, as it appears from day to day, is <i>pro
tanto</i> incomplete. Another very important series of transactions
which is not included in the ordinary day-to-day record is that
representing the loss gradually accruing by reason of waste,
or depreciation, of assets or general equipment of the business;
proper allowance for these losses must of course be made whenever
it is desired to ascertain the true position of affairs.</p>

<p>The origin of book-keeping is lost in obscurity, but recent
researches would appear to show that some method of keeping
accounts has existed from the remotest times. Babylonian
records have been found dating back as far as
<span class="sidenote">History.</span>
2600 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, written with a stylus on small slabs of clay, and it is
of interest to note (<i>Records of the Past</i>, xi. 89) that these slabs
or tablets &ldquo;usually contain impressions from cylinder seals,
and nail marks, which were considered to be a man&rsquo;s natural
seal,&rdquo; thus showing that the modern method of identifying
criminals by finger prints had its counterpart in Babylonia some
4500 years ago. Egyptian records were commonly written on
papyrus, and contemporary pictures show a scribe keeping
account of the quantities of grain brought into and removed from
the government store-houses. It will thus be seen that some
form of book-keeping existed long before bound books were
known, and therefore the more general term <i>accounting</i> would
seem to be preferable&mdash;the more so as the most modern developments
are in the direction of again abandoning the bound book
in favour of loose or easily detached sheets of paper or card, thus
capable of being rearranged as circumstances or convenience
may dictate. Most of the earlier accounting records are in the
nature of a mere narrative of events, which&mdash;however complete
in itself&mdash;failed to fulfil the second requirement of an adequate
system of book-keeping already referred to. Prior to the use
of money nothing in this direction could of course well be attempted;
but for a long time after its employment became
general money values were recorded in Roman figures, which
naturally did not lend themselves to ready calculation.</p>

<p>At the present-time it may be generally stated that all book-keeping
records are kept in three distinct columns, dealing
respectively with the date of the transaction, its nature, and its
money value. The earliest extant example of accounts so kept
is probably a ledger in the Advocates&rsquo; library at Edinburgh,
dated 1697, which, it is of interest to note, is ruled by hand.
Prior to that time, however, double-entry book-keeping had been
in general use. The exact date of its introduction is unknown;
but it was certainly not, as has been frequently stated, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>
invention of Lucas de Bergo, in or about 1494. This, however,
is the date of the first issue (at Venice) of a printed book entitled
<i>Everything about Arithmetic, Geometry and Proportion</i>, by Luca
Paciolo, which contains <i>inter alia</i> an explanation of book-keeping
by double-entry as then understood; but in all probability,
the system had then been in use for something like 200 years.
It is perhaps unfortunate that from 1494 until comparatively
recent times the literature of accounting has been provided by
theorists and students, rather than by practical business men, and
it may well be doubted, therefore, whether it accurately describes
contemporary procedure. Another illusion which it is necessary
to expose in the interests of truth is the value attached to
<i>Jones&rsquo;s English System of Book-keeping by Single or Double
Entry</i>, published at Bristol in 1796. Before publishing this
book, E.T. Jones issued a prospectus, stating that he had
patented an entirely new and greatly improved system, and that
subscribers (at a guinea a copy) would be entitled to a special
licence empowering them to put the new invention into practice
in their own book-keeping. With this bait he secured thousands
of subscribers, but so far as can be gathered his system was
entirely without merit, and it is chiefly of interest as indicating
the value, even then, of advertising.</p>

<p>It is impossible here to describe fully all the improvements
that have been made in methods of accounting during recent
years, but it is proposed to deal with the more important
<span class="sidenote">Modern methods.</span>
of these improvements, after the general
principles upon which all systems of book-keeping
are based have been briefly described.</p>

<p>The centre of all book-keeping systems is the
<i>ledger</i>, and it may be said that all other books are
only kept as a matter of practical convenience&mdash;
hence the name &ldquo;subsidiary books&rdquo; that is
frequently applied thereto. Inasmuch, however, as
the transactions are first recorded in these subsidiary
books, and afterwards classified therefrom
into the ledger, the names <i>books of entry</i> or <i>books
of first entry</i> are often employed. Subsidiary books
which do not form the basis of subsequent entries
into the ledger, but are merely used for statistical
purposes, are known as <i>statistical</i> or <i>auxiliary books</i>.
In the early days of book-keeping the ledger comprised
merely those accounts which it was thought
desirable to keep accessible, and was not a complete
record of all transactions. Thus in many instances
records were only kept of transactions with other
business houses, known as <i>personal accounts</i>. In the earliest
examples transactions tending to reduce indebtedness were
recorded in order of date, as they occurred underneath
transactions recording the creation of the indebtedness; and
the amount of the reduction was subtracted from the sum
of the indebtedness up to that date. This method was found
to be inconvenient, and the next step was to keep one
account of the transactions recording the creation of indebtedness
and another account (called the <i>contra account</i>) of those
transactions reducing or extinguishing it. For convenience
these two accounts were kept on opposite sides of the ledger,
and thus was evolved the <i>Dr</i>. and <i>Cr</i>. account as at present
in general use:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcc"><i>Dr</i>.</td> <td class="tcc">A.B.</td> <td class="tcc">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcc">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcc">Contra.</td> <td class="tcc"><i>Cr</i>.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tcc lb rb">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcc rb">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcc rb2">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcc rb">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcc rb">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcc rb">&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In this form of account all transactions creating indebtedness
due from the person named therein to the business&mdash;that is to
say, all benefits received by that person from the buisness&mdash;are
recorded upon the left-hand, or <i>Dr</i>. side, and  <i>per contra</i> all
transactions representing benefits imparted by him, giving
rise to a liability on the part of the business, are recorded
upon the <i>Cr</i>. side. The account may run on indefinitely,
but as a matter of convenience is usually ruled off each time
all indebtedness is extinguished, and also at certain periodical
intervals, so that the state of the account may then be readily
apparent.</p>

<p>A mere collection of <i>personal accounts</i> is, however, obviously a
very incomplete record of the transactions of any business,
and does not suffice to enable a statement of its financial
position to be prepared. So at an early date other
<span class="sidenote">Single-entry accounts.</span>
accounts were added to the ledger, recording the
acquisition of and disposal of different classes of
property, such accounts being generally known as <i>real accounts</i>.
These accounts are kept upon the same principle as personal
accounts, in that all expenditure upon the part of the business
is recorded upon the <i>Dr</i>. side, and all receipts upon the <i>Cr</i>. side;
the excess of the debit entries over the credit entries thus showing
the value placed upon those assets that still remain the property
of the business. With the aid of personal and real accounts
properly written up to date, it is possible at any time to
prepare a statement of assets and liabilities showing the financial
position of a business, and the following is an example of such a
statement, which shows also how the profit made by the business
may be thus ascertained, assuming that the financial position
at the commencement of the current financial period, and the
movements of capital into and out of the business during the
period, are capable of being ascertained.</p>

<p>The method of accounting hitherto described represents
<i>single-entry</i>, which&mdash;albeit manifestly incomplete&mdash;is still very
generally used by small business houses, and particularly by
retail traders. Its essential weakness is that it provides no automatic
check upon the clerical accuracy of the record, and,
should any mistake be made in the keeping of the books, or in
the extraction therefrom of the lists of assets and liabilities,
the statement of assets and liabilities and the profit or loss of the
current financial period, will be incorrect to an equal extent.
It was to avoid this obvious weakness of single-entry that the
system of double-entry was evolved.</p>

<p>The essential principle of double-entry is that it constitutes
a complete record of <i>every</i> business transaction, and as these
transactions are invariably cross-dealings&mdash;involving
simultaneously the receipt of a benefit by some one
<span class="sidenote">Double-entry.</span>
and the imparting of a benefit by some one&mdash;a complete
record of transactions from both points of view necessitates an
entry of equal amount upon debit and credit sides of the ledger.
Hence it follows that, if the clerical work be correctly performed,
the aggregate amount entered up upon the debit side of the ledger
must at all times equal the aggregate amount entered up upon
the credit side; and thus a complete list of all ledger balances
will show an agreement of the total debit balances with the total
credit balances. Such a list is called a <i>trial balance</i>, an example
of which is given below. It should be observed, however, that
the test supplied by the <i>trial balance</i> is a purely mechanical
one, and does not prove the absolute accuracy of the ledger as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>
a record of transactions. Thus transactions which have
actually taken place may have been omitted from the books
altogether, or they may have been recorded to the wrong
accounts, or the money values attached to them may be
incorrect; or, yet again, fictitious records may be entered
in the ledger of transactions which have never taken place.
A <i>trial balance</i> is thus no very adequate safeguard against fraud,
nor does it bring to light mistakes in the monetary value attaching
to the various transactions recorded. This last point is of
especial importance, in that the monetary value of transactions
may have been correctly recorded in the first instance, but owing
to altered circumstances may have become inaccurate at a later
date. This of course means that the altered circumstances
constitute an additional &ldquo;transaction&rdquo; which has been omitted.</p>

<p>It will be observed, therefore, that in order to complete the
record of the transactions by double-entry, it has become
necessary to introduce into the ledger a third class of accounts,
known as <i>impersonal</i> or <i>nominal accounts</i>. These accounts record
the transferences of money, or of money&rsquo;s worth, which, so far
from representing a mere reshuffling of assets and liabilities,
involve an increase in or a reduction of the amount invested in
the business, <i>i.e.</i> a profit or a loss. Transactions representing
profits are recorded upon the <i>Cr.</i> side of nominal accounts, and
those representing losses (including expenses) upon the <i>Dr.</i> side.
This is consistent with the rules already laid down in connexion
with real and nominal accounts, inasmuch as expenditure which
does not result in the acquisition of an asset is a loss, whereas
receipts which do not involve the creation of liabilities represent
profits. All debit balances therefore that are not assets are
losses, and <i>per contra</i> all credit balances that are not liabilities
are profits. So that, inasmuch as double-entry provides <i>inter
alia</i> a complete statement under suitable headings of all profits
and all losses, it is possible by aggregating these results to
deduce therefrom the net profit or loss of carrying on the business&mdash;and
that by a method entirely distinct from that previously
described in connexion with single-entry, thus constituting a
valuable additional check. Taking the trial balance shown above,
the following represent the <i>trading account</i>, <i>profit and loss account</i>,
<span class="sidenote">Balance sheet.</span>
and <i>balance sheet</i> compiled therefrom. The trading
account may be variously regarded as the account
recording the movements of goods which represent the
stock-in-trade, and as a preliminary to (or a subdivision of) the
profit and loss account. The balance sheet is a statement of
the assets and liabilities; but&mdash;inasmuch as, by transferring the
balance of the profit and loss account to the capital account, it is
possible to bring the latter account up to date and to show the
credit balance representing the surplus of assets over liabilities
to date&mdash;the balance sheet, instead of showing a difference, or a
&ldquo;balance,&rdquo; representing what is <i>assumed to be</i> the amount of the
capital to date, shows an absolute agreement of assets upon the
one hand and of liabilities <i>plus</i> capital upon the other. The two
sides of the account thus balance&mdash;hence the name.</p>

<p>In the foregoing example the customary method has been
followed of deducting withdrawals of capital from the capital
account and of adding profits thereto. Sometimes, however, the
balance of the capital account remains constant, and the drawings
and net profits are transferred to a separate account called
<i>current account</i>. This plan is but rarely observed in the case
of undertakings owned by individuals, or private firms, but is
invariably adopted in connexion with joint-stock companies,
although in such cases the name <i>appropriation of profit account</i> is
generally employed.</p>

<p>Although it is now usual to employ several books of first-entry,
in the case of comparatively small businesses one such book is
sufficient for all purposes, in that it is practicable for
one person to record all the transactions that take
<span class="sidenote">Journal.</span>
place as and when they occur. A book of this description is
called the <i>journal</i>, and for many years represented the only book
of first-entry employed in book-keeping. An example of the
journal is given below. The entries appearing therein are such
as would be necessary to prepare the trading and profit and loss
accounts from the trial balance shown above, and to bring the
capital account up to date.</p>

<p>In modern times, however, with the growth of business, it
was soon found impracticable to keep one book of first-entry for
all transactions, and accordingly it became necessary either to
treat the journal as an intermediate book, in which the transactions
might be brought together and focused as a preliminary
to being recorded in the ledger, or else to split up the journal
into numerous books of first-entry, each of which might in that
case be employed for the record of a particular class of transaction.
The first method has been generally adopted in the continental
countries of Europe, as will be shown later on, whereas in Great
Britain and in North America the latter method more generally
obtains; that is, instead of having one journal in which all classes
of transactions are recorded in the first instance, it is usual to
employ several journals, as follows:&mdash;a <i>sales journal, sales book</i>
or <i>day book</i>, to record particulars of goods sold; a <i>bought journal,
invoice book</i> or <i>purchases book</i>, to record particulars of goods purchased;
a <i>returns inwards book</i>, to record particulars of goods sold
but subsequently returned by customers; a <i>returns outwards book</i>,
to record the like particulars with regard to goods purchased and
subsequently returned; a <i>bills receivable book</i>, to record particulars
of bills of exchange received from debtors; and a <i>bills payable
book</i>, to record particulars of bills of exchange given to creditors.</p>

<p>With a view still further to split up the work, thus enabling a
large staff to be simultaneously engaged, the ledger itself is
now generally kept in sections. Thus the cash account and the
bank account are frequently bound together in one separate
book called the <i>cash book</i>, showing in parallel columns the movements
of office cash and of cash at the bank, and by the addition
of a third column for discounts the necessity of keeping an
additional book of first entry as a <i>discount journal</i> may also be
avoided. Of late years, however, most businesses pay all moneys
received into their bankers without deduction, and pay all
accounts by cheque; the necessity of an account for office cash
thus no longer exists, save in connexion with petty payments,
which are recorded in a separate book called the <i>petty cash book</i>.
With regard to the remaining ledger
accounts, personal accounts&mdash;which are the
most numerous&mdash;are frequently separated
from the real and nominal accounts, and
are further subdivided so that customers&rsquo;
accounts are kept separate from the
accounts of trade creditors. The customers&rsquo;
accounts are kept in a ledger (or, if need be,
in several ledgers) called <i>sales ledgers</i>, or
<i>sold ledgers</i>; while the accounts of trade
creditors are similarly kept in <i>purchases
ledgers</i> or <i>bought ledgers</i>. The nominal and
real accounts, if together, are kept in what
is called the <i>general ledger</i>; but this may
be further subdivided into a <i>nominal
ledger</i> and a <i>private ledger</i>. This last subdivision
is, however, rarely made upon a
scientific basis, for such accounts as the
profit and loss account and trading account
are generally kept in the private ledger
although strictly speaking nominal accounts;
while the bills receivable account and the
bills payable account are generally kept in
the nominal ledger, so as to reduce to a
minimum the amount of clerical work in
connexion with the private ledger, which
is kept either by the principal himself or
by his confidential employee. By the employment of <i>adjustment
accounts</i>, which complete the double-entry record in each
ledger, these various ledgers may readily be made self-balancing,
thus enabling clerical errors to be localized and responsibility
enforced.</p>

<p>Of recent years considerable attention has been devoted to
further modifications of book-keeping methods with a view to
reducing clerical work, increasing the speed with which results
are available, and enabling them to be handled more quickly
<span class="sidenote">Tabular book-keeping.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span>
and with greater certainty. <i>Tabular book-keeping</i> is a device to
achieve one or more of these ends by the substitution of books
ruled with numerous columns for the more usual
form. The system may be applied either to books of
first entry or to ledgers. As applied to books of first-entry
it enables the same book to deal conveniently
with more than one class of transaction; thus if the trading
of a business is divided into several departments, by
providing a separate column for the sales of each department
it is possible readily to arrive at separate totals for
the aggregate sales of each, thus simplifying the preparation
of departmental trading accounts. As applied to ledgers, the
application of the system may be best described by the aid
of the above example (the proceedings of the columns being
given only), which shows how a very large number of personal
accounts may be recorded upon a single opening of a ledger
provided the number of entries to be made against each
individual be few.</p>

<p>Another important application of modern methods consists
of what may be described as the <i>slip system</i>, which is in many
respects a reversion to the method of keeping records
upon movable slabs or tablets, as in the Babylonian accounts
<span class="sidenote">Slip system.</span>
referred to at the beginning of this article. This
system may be applied to books of first-entry, or to ledgers, or to
both. As applied to books of first-entry it aims at so modifying
the original record of the transaction&mdash;whether it represents an
invoice for goods sold or an acknowledgment given for money
received&mdash;that a facsimile duplicate may be taken of the original
entry by the aid of a carbon sheet, which instead of being
immovably bound up in a book is capable of being handled
separately and placed in any desired order or position, and thus
more readily recorded in the ledger. Postings are thus made
direct from the original slips, which have been first sorted out
into an order convenient for that purpose, and afterwards resorted
so that the total sales of each department may be readily
computed; after which they are filed away in a form convenient
for reference. Sometimes the process is carried a step further,
and the original slips, filed away with suitable guide-cards
indicating the nature of the account, themselves constitute the
ledger record&mdash;which in such cases is to be found scattered over a
number of sheets, one for each transaction, instead of, as in the
case of the ordinary book ledger, a considerable number of transactions
being recorded upon a single page. This adaptation of the
slip system is impracticable except in cases where the transactions
with each individual are few in number, and is not worth adoption
unless the exceedingly large number of personal accounts makes it
important as far as possible to avoid all duplication of clerical
work. The more usual adaptation of the slip system to ledgers
is to be found in the employment of <i>card ledgers</i> or <i>loose-leaf
ledgers</i>. With card ledgers (fig. 1) each ledger account is upon
an independent sheet of cardboard suitably arranged in drawers
or cabinets. The system is advantageous as allowing all dead
matter to be eliminated from the record continuously in use, and
as permitting the order in which the accounts stand to be varied
from time to time as convenience dictates, thus (if necessary)
enabling the accounts to be always kept in alphabetical order
in spite of the addition of new accounts and the dropping out
of old ones. An especial convenience of the card system is that
in times of pressure any desired number of book-keepers may be
simultaneously employed, whereas the maximum number that
can be usefully employed upon any bound book is two. The
loose-leaf ledger (fig. 2) may be described as midway between
card and bound ledgers. It consists of a number of sheets in
book form, so bound as to be capable of being readily separated
when desired. The loose-leaf ledger thus embraces most of the
advantages of the card ledger, while remaining sufficiently like
the more old-fashioned book ledger as to enable it to be readily
handled by those whose previous experience has been confined
to the latter. Both the card and loose-leaf systems will be
frequently found of value for records in connexion with cost
and stores accounts, quite irrespective of their advantages in
connexion with the book-keeping records pure and simple of
certain businesses.</p>

<p>All book-keeping methods rest upon the same fundamental
principles, but their development in practice in different countries
is to some extent influenced by the manner in which
business is there conducted, and by the legislative
<span class="sidenote">Legislative Requirements.</span>
requirements imposed by the several states. In France
traders are required by the Code of Commerce to keep
three books&mdash;a journal, an inventory and a letter book, somewhat
elaborate provisions being made to identify these books,
and to prevent substitution. The compulsory journal makes
the employment of numerous books of first-entry impossible
without an undesirable amount of duplication, and wherever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>230</span>
this provision obtains the book-keeping methods are in an
accordingly comparatively backward state. The inventory book
comprises periodical lists of ledger balances and the balance
sheet, records which are invariably kept under every adequate
system, although not always in a book specially set aside for that
purpose. In Germany the statutory requirements are similar
to those in France, save that the journal is not compulsory;
but there is an additional provision that the accounts are to
be kept in <i>bound</i> books with the pages numbered consecutively&mdash;a
requirement which makes the introduction of card or loose-leaf
ledgers of doubtful legality. A balance sheet must be drawn
up every year; but where a stock-in-trade is from its nature
or its size difficult to take, it is sufficient for an inventory to
be taken every two years. In Belgium the law requires every
merchant to keep a journal recording his transactions from
day to day, which (with the balance book) must be initialled by
a prescribed officer. All letters and telegrams received, and
copies of all such sent, must be preserved for ten years. The
Commercial Code of Spain requires an inventory, journal, ledger,
letter book and invoice book to be kept; while that of Portugal
prescribes the use of a balance book, journal, ledger and
copy-letter book. The law of Holland requires business men to keep
books in which are correctly recorded their commercial transactions,
letters received and copies of letters sent. It also provides
for the preparation of an annual balance sheet. The law of
Rumania makes the employment of journal, inventory book and
ledger compulsory, a small tax per page being charged on the
two first named. There are no special provisions as to book-keeping
contained in the Russian law, nor in the United States
law, but in Russia public companies have to supply the government
with copies of their annual accounts, which are published
in a state newspaper, and in the United States certain classes of
companies have to submit their accounts to an official audit.
In general terms it may be stated that at the present time the
employment of card and loose-leaf ledger systems is more general
in the United States than in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Apart from the organizations of professional accountants,
there is none of note devoted to the scientific study of
book-keeping other than purely educational institutions.
Among the universities those in the United States were
<span class="sidenote">Education.</span>
the first to include accounting as part of their curriculum;
while in Great Britain the London School of Economics (university
of London), the university of Birmingham, and the
Victoria University of Manchester have, so far, alone treated
the subject seriously and upon adequate lines. Quite recently
Japan has been making a movement in the same direction, and
other countries will doubtless follow suit. In England there have
for a number of years past been various bodies&mdash;such for instance
as the Society of Arts, the London Chamber of Commerce
and Owens College, Manchester&mdash;which hold examinations in
book-keeping and grant diplomas to successful candidates,
while most of the polytechnics and technical schools give
instruction in book-keeping; these latter, however, for the most
part regard it as a &ldquo;craft&rdquo; merely.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Authorities</span>.&mdash;Those interested in the bibliography of book-keeping
are referred to the catalogue of the library of the Institute
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, which probably
contains the most complete collection in existence of ancient and
modern works on accounting, both British and foreign. The following
short list comprises those most likely to be found of general interest:
G. van de Linde, <i>Book-keeping</i> (1898); L.R. Dicksee, <i>Book-keeping</i>

<p><span class="bold">BOOK-PLATES.<a name="ar135" id="ar135"></a></span> The book-plate, or <i>ex-libris</i>, a printed label
intended to indicate ownership in individual volumes, is nearly
as old as the printed book itself. It bears very much the same
relation to the hand-painted armorial or otherwise symbolical
personal device found in medieval manuscripts that the printed
page does to the scribe&rsquo;s work. The earliest known examples
of book-plates are German. According to Friedrich Warnecke,
of Berlin (one of the best authorities on the subject), the oldest
movable <i>ex-libris</i> are certain woodcuts representing a shield of
arms supported by an angel (fig. 1), which were pasted in books
presented to the Carthusian monastery of Buxheim by Brother
Hildebrand Brandenburg of Biberach, about the year 1480&mdash;the
date being fixed by that of the recorded gift. The woodcut,
in imitation of similar devices in old MSS., is hand-painted. In
France the most ancient <i>ex-libris</i> as yet discovered is that of one
Jean Bertaud de la Tour-Blanche, the date of which is 1529;
and in England that of Sir Nicholas Bacon, a gift-plate for the
books he presented to the university of Cambridge (fig. 2).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>231</span>
Holland comes next with the plate of a certain Anna van der Aa,
in 1597; then Italy with one attributed to the year 1622.
The earliest known American example is the plain printed label
of one John Williams, 1679.</p>

<p>A sketch of the history of the book-plate, either as a minor
work of symbolical and decorative art, or as an accessory to the
binding of books, must obviously begin in Germany, not only
because the earliest examples known are German, but also
because they are found in great numbers long before the fashion
spread to other countries, and are often of the highest artistic
interest. Albrecht Dürer is known to have actually engraved at
least six plates (some of very important size) between 1503 and
1516 (fig. 3), and to have supplied designs for many others.
Several notable plates are ascribed to Lucas Cranach and to
Hans Holbein, and to that bevy of so-called Little Masters, the
Behams, Virgil Solis, Matthias Zundt, Jost Amman, Saldörfer,
Georg Hüpschmann and others. The influence of these draughtsmen
over the decorative styles of Germany has been felt through
subsequent centuries down to the present day, notwithstanding
the invasion of successive Italian and French fashions during the
17th and 18th centuries, and the marked effort at originality of
composition observable among modern designers. The heavy,
over-elaborated German style never seems to have affected
neighbouring countries; but since it was undoubtedly from
Germany that was spread the fashion of ornamental book-plates
as marks of possession, the history of German <i>ex-libris</i> remains on
that account one of high interest to all those who are curious in
the matter.</p>

<p>It was not before the 17th century that the <i>movable ex-libris</i>
became tolerably common in France. Up to that time the more
luxurious habit of stamping the cover with a personal device
had been in such general favour with book-owners as to render
the use of labels superfluous. From the middle of the century,
however, the <i>ex-libris</i> proper became quite naturalized; examples
of that period are very numerous, and, as a rule, are very handsome.
It may be here pointed out that the expression <i>ex-libris</i>,
used as a substantive, which is now the recognized term for
book-plate everywhere on the continent, found its origin in
France. The words only occur in the personal tokens of other
nationalities long after they had become a recognized inscription
on French labels.</p>

<p>In many ways the consideration of the English book-plate,
in its numerous styles, from the late Elizabethan to the late
Victorian period, is peculiarly interesting. In all its varieties it
reflects with great fidelity the prevailing taste in decorative art
at different epochs. Of English examples, none thus far seems
to have been discovered of older date than the gift-plate of
Sir Nicholas Bacon; for the celebrated, gorgeous, hand-painted
armorial device attached to a folio that once belonged to Henry
VIII., and now reposes in the King&rsquo;s library, British Museum,
does not come under the head of book-plate in its modern sense.
The next is that of Sir Thomas Tresham, dated 1585. Until the
last quarter of the 17th century the number of authentic English
plates is very limited. Their composition is always remarkably
simple, and displays nothing of the German elaborateness. They
are as a rule very plainly armorial, and the decoration is usually
limited to a symmetrical arrangement of mantling, with an occasional
display of palms or wreaths. Soon after the Restoration,
however, a book-plate seems to have suddenly become an established
accessory to most well-ordered libraries. Book-plates of
that period offer very distinctive characteristics. In the simplicity
of their heraldic arrangements they recall those of the
previous age; but their physiognomy is totally different. In the
first place, they invariably display the tincture lines and dots,
after the method originally devised in the middle of the century
by Petra Sancta, the author of <i>Tesserae Gentilitiae</i>, which by this
time had become adopted throughout Europe. In the second,
the mantling assumes a much more elaborate appearance&mdash;one
that irresistibly recalls that of the periwig of the period&mdash;surrounding
the face of the shield. This style was undoubtedly
imported from France, but it assumed a character of its own in
England. As a matter of fact, thenceforth until the dawn of
the French Revolution, English modes of decoration in book-plates,
as in most other chattels, follow at some years&rsquo; distance
the ruling French taste. The main characteristics of the style
which prevailed during the Queen Anne and early Georgian
periods are:&mdash;ornamental frames suggestive of carved oak, a
frequent use of fish-scales, trellis or diapered patterns, for the
decoration of plain surfaces; and, in the armorial display, a
marked reduction in the importance of the mantling. The introduction
of the scallop-shell as an almost constant element of
ornamentation gives already a foretaste of the <i>Rocaille-Coquille</i>,
the so-called Chippendale fashions of the next reign. As a matter
of fact, during the middle third of the century this rococo style
(of which the Convers plate [fig. 4] gives a tolerably typical
sample) affects the book-plate as universally as all other decorative
objects. Its chief element is a fanciful arrangement of
scroll and shell work with curveting acanthus-like sprays&mdash;an
arrangement which in the examples of the best period is generally
made asymmetrical in order to give freer scope for a variety of
countercurves. Straight or concentric lines and all appearances
of flat surface are studiously avoided; the helmet and its
symmetrical mantling tends to disappear, and is replaced by the
plain crest on a fillet. The earlier examples of this manner are
tolerably ponderous and simple. Later, however, the composition
becomes exceedingly light and complicated; every
conceivable and often incongruous element of decoration is
introduced, from cupids to dragons, from flowerets to Chinese
pagodas. During the early part of George III.&rsquo;s reign there is
a return to greater sobriety of ornamentation, and a style more
truly national, which may be called <i>the urn style</i>, makes its
appearance. Book-plates of this period have invariably a
physiognomy which at once recalls the decorative manner made
popular by architects and designers such as Chambers, the
Adams, Josiah Wedgwood, Hepplewhite and Sheraton. The
shield shows a plain spade-like outline, manifestly based upon
that of the pseudo-classic urn then so much to the fore. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span>
ornamental accessories are symmetrical palms and sprays,
wreaths and ribands. The architectural boss is also an important
factor. In many plates, indeed, the shield of arms takes
quite a subsidiary position by the side of the predominantly
architectural urn. From the beginning of the 19th century, until
comparatively recent days, no special style of decoration seems
to have established itself. The immense majority of examples
display a plain shield of arms with motto on a scroll below, and
crest on a fillet above. Of late years, however, a rapid impetus
appears to have been given to the designing of <i>ex-libris</i>; a new
era, in fact, has begun for the book-plate, one of great interest.</p>

<p>The main styles of decoration (and these, other data being
absent, must always in the case of old examples remain the
criteria of date) have already been noticed. It is, however,
necessary to point out that certain styles of composition were
also prevalent at certain periods. Many of the older plates (like
the majority of the most modern ones) were essentially pictorial.
Of this kind the best-defined English genus may be recalled:
<i>the library interior</i>&mdash;a term which explains itself&mdash;and <i>book-piles</i>,
exemplified by the <i>ex-libris</i> (fig. 6) of W. Hewer, Samuel
Pepys&rsquo;s secretary. We have also many <i>portrait-plates</i>, of which,
perhaps, the most notable are those of Samuel Pepys himself
and of John Gibbs, the architect; <i>allegories</i>, such as were engraved
by Hogarth, Bartolozzi, John Pine and George Vertue;
<i>landscape-plates</i>, by wood engravers of the Bewick school (see
Plate), &amp;c. In most of these the armorial element plays but a
secondary part.</p>

<p>The value attached to book-plates, otherwise than as an object
of purely personal interest, is comparatively modern. The study
of and the taste for collecting these private tokens of book-ownership
hardly date farther back than the year 1875. The
first real impetus was given by the appearance of the <i>Guide to
the Study of Book-Plates</i>, by Lord de Tabley (then the Hon.
Leicester Warren) in 1880. This work, highly interesting from
many points of view, established what is now accepted as the
general classification of styles: <i>early armorial</i> (<i>i.e</i>. previous to
Restoration, exemplified by the Nicholas Bacon plate); <i>Jacobean</i>,
a somewhat misleading term, but distinctly understood to include
the heavy decorative manner of the Restoration, Queen Anne
and early Georgian days (the Lansanor plate, fig. 5, is typically
Jacobean); <i>Chippendale</i> (the style above described as <i>rococo</i>,
tolerably well represented by the French plate of Convers);
<i>wreath and ribbon</i>, belonging to the period described as that of
the urn, &amp;c. Since then the literature on the subject has grown
considerably. Societies of collectors have been founded, first
in England, then in Germany and France, and in the United
States, most of them issuing a journal or archives:
<i>The Journal of the Ex-libris Society</i> (London), the <i>Archives
de la société française de collectionneurs d&rsquo;ex-libris</i> (Paris),
both of these monthlies; the <i>Ex-libris Zeitschrift</i> (Berlin), a
quarterly.</p>

<p>Much has been written for and against book-plate collecting.
If, on the one hand, the more enthusiastic ex-librists (for
such a word has actually been coined) have made the somewhat
ridiculous claim of science for &ldquo;ex-librisme,&rdquo; the bitter
animadversion, on the other, of a certain class of intolerant
bibliophiles upon the vandalism of removing book-plates
from old books has at times been rather extravagant. Book-plates
are undoubtedly very often of high interest (and of a value
often far greater than the odd volume in which they are found
affixed), either as specimens of bygone decorative fashion or as
personal relics of well-known personages. There can be no

<p>Until the advent of the new taste the devising of book-plates
was almost invariably left to the routine skill of the heraldic
stationer. Of late years the composition of personal book-tokens
has become recognized as a minor branch of a higher art,
and there has come into fashion an entirely new class of designs
which, for all their wonderful variety, bear as unmistakable a
character as that of the most definite styles of bygone days.
Broadly speaking, it may be said that the purely heraldic element
tends to become subsidiary and the allegorical or symbolic to
assert itself more strongly. Among modern English artists who
have more specially paid attention to the devising of book-plates,
and have produced admirable designs, may be mentioned C.W.
Sherborn, G.W. Eve, Robert Anning Bell, J.D. Batten, Erat
Harrison, J. Forbes Nixon, Charles Ricketts, John Vinycomb,
John Leighton and Warrington Hogg. The development in
various directions of process work, by facilitating and cheapening
the reproduction of beautiful and elaborate designs, has
no doubt helped much to popularize the book-plate&mdash;a thing
which in older days was almost invariably restricted to ancestral
libraries or to collections otherwise important. Thus the great
majority of modern plates are reproduced by process. There
are, however, a few artists left who devote to book-plates their
skill with the graver. Some of the work they produce challenges
comparison with the finest productions of bygone engravers.
Of these the best-known are C.W. Sherborn (see Plate) and G.W.
Eve in England, and in America J.W. Spenceley of Boston,
Mass., K.W.F. Hopson of New Haven, Conn., and E.D. French
of New York City (see Plate).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOOK-SCORPION,<a name="ar136" id="ar136"></a></span> or <span class="sc">False Scorpion</span>, minute arachnids
superficially resembling tailless scorpions and belonging to the
order Pseudoscorpiones of the class Arachnida. Occurring in
all temperate and tropical countries, book-scorpions live for the
most part under stones, beneath the bark of trees or in vegetable
detritus. A few species, however, like the common British forms
<i>Chelifer cancroides</i> and <i>Chiridium museorum</i>, frequent human
dwellings and are found in books, old chests, furniture, &amp;c;
others like <i>Ganypus littoralis</i> and allied species may be found
under stones or pieces of coral between tide-marks; while others,
which are for the most part blind, live permanently in dark caves.
Their food consists of minute insects or mites. It is possibly
for the purpose of feeding on parasitic mites that book-scorpions
lodge themselves beneath the wing-cases of large tropical beetles;
and the same explanation, in default of a better, may be extended
to their well-known and oft-recorded habit of seizing hold of the
legs of horse-flies or other two-winged insects. For safety
during hibernation and moulting, book-scorpions spin a small
spherical cocoon. They are oviparous; and the eggs after being
laid are carried about by the mother, attached to the lower
surface of her body, the young remaining with their parent until
they have acquired their definite form and are able to shift for
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOOKSELLING.<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span> The trade in books is of a very ancient
date. The early poets and orators recited their effusions in
public to induce their hearers to possess written copies of their
poems or orations. Frequently they were taken down <i>viva voce</i>,
and transcripts sold to such as were wealthy enough to purchase.
In the book of Jeremiah the prophet is represented as dictating to
Baruch the scribe, who, when questioned, described the mode
in which his book was written. These scribes were, in fact,
the earliest booksellers, and supplied copies as they were demanded.
Aristotle, we are told, possessed a somewhat extensive
library; and Plato is recorded to have paid the large sum of
one hundred minae for three small treatises of Philolaus the
Pythagorean. When the Alexandrian library was founded about
300 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, various expedients were resorted to for the purpose
of procuring books, and this appears to have stimulated the
energies of the Athenian booksellers, who were termed
<span class="grk" title="biblion kapaeloi">&#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#8054;&#969;&#957; &#954;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span>. In Rome, towards the end of the republic, it became
the fashion to have a library as part of the household furniture;
and the booksellers, <i>librarii</i> (Cic. <i>D. Leg.</i> iii. 20) or <i>bibliopolae</i>
(Martial iv. 71, xiii. 3), carried on a flourishing trade. Their
shops (<i>taberna librarii</i>, Cicero, <i>Phil.</i> ii. 9) were chiefly in the
Argiletum, and in the Vicus Sandalarius. On the door, or on
the side posts, was a list of the books on sale; and Martial
(i. 118), who mentions this also, says that a copy of his First
Book of Epigrams might be purchased for five denarii. In the
time of Augustus the great booksellers were the Sosii. According
to Justinian (ii. I. 33), a law was passed securing to the scribes
the property in the materials used; and in this may, perhaps,
be traced the first germ of the modern law of copyright.</p>

<p>The spread of Christianity naturally created a great demand
for copies of the Gospels and other sacred books, and later on
for missals and other devotional volumes for church and private
use. Benedict Biscop, the founder of the abbey at Wearmouth
in England, brought home with him from France (671) a whole
cargo of books, part of which he had &ldquo;bought,&rdquo; but from whom
is not mentioned. Passing by the intermediate ages we find that
previous to the Reformation, the text writers or stationers
(<i>stacyoneres</i>), who sold copies of the books then in use&mdash;the
ABC, the Paternoster, Creed, Ave Maria and other MS. copies
of prayers, in the neighbourhood of St Paul&rsquo;s, London,&mdash;were,
in 1403, formed into a gild. Some of these &ldquo;stacyoneres&rdquo; had
stalls or stations built against the very walls of the cathedral
itself, in the same manner as they are still to be found in some
of the older continental cities. In Henry Anstey&rsquo;s <i>Munimenta
Academica</i>, published under the direction of the master of the
rolls, we catch a glimpse of the &ldquo;sworn&rdquo; university bookseller
or stationer, John More of Oxford, who apparently first supplied
pupils with their books, and then acted the part of a pawnbroker.
Anstey says (p. 77), &ldquo;The fact is that they (the students) mostly
could not afford to buy books, and had they been able, would
not have found the advantage so considerable as might be supposed,
the instruction given being almost wholly oral. The
chief source of supplying books was by purchase from the
university sworn stationers, who had to a great extent a monopoly.
Of such books there were plainly very large numbers
constantly changing hands.&rdquo; Besides the sworn stationers
there were many booksellers in Oxford who were not sworn; for
one of the statutes, passed in the year 1373, expressly recites that,
in consequence of their presence, &ldquo;books of great value are sold
and carried away from Oxford, the owners of them are cheated,
and the sworn stationers are deprived of their lawful business.&rdquo;
It was, therefore, enacted that no bookseller except two sworn
stationers or their deputies, should sell any book being either
his own property or that of another, exceeding half a mark in
value, under a pain of imprisonment, or, if the offence was
repeated, of abjuring his trade within the university.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trade in bookselling seems,&rdquo; says Hallam, &ldquo;to have been
established at Paris and Bologna in the 12th century; the
lawyers and universities called it into life. It is very improbable
that it existed in what we properly call the dark ages. Peter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>
Blois mentions a book which he had bought of a public dealer
(<i>a quodam publico mangone librorum</i>); but we do not find many
distinct accounts of them till the next age. These dealers were
denominated <i>stationarii</i>, perhaps from the open stalls at which
they carried on their business, though <i>statio</i> is a general word
for a shop in low Latin. They appear, by the old statutes of
the university of Paris, and by those of Bologna, to have sold
books upon commission, and are sometimes, though not uniformly,
distinguished from the <i>librarii</i>, a word which, having originally
been confined to the copyists of books, was afterwards applied
to those who traded in them. They sold parchment and other
materials of writing, which have retained the name of stationery,
and they naturally exercised the kindred occupations of binding
and decorating. They probably employed transcribers; we
find at least that there was a profession of copyists in the
universities and in large cities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The modern system of bookselling dates from soon after the
introduction of printing. The earliest printers were also editors
and booksellers; but being unable to sell every copy of the works
they printed, they had agents at most of the seats of learning.
Antony Koburger, who introduced the art of printing into
Nuremberg in 1470, although a printer, was more of a bookseller;
for, besides his own sixteen shops, we are informed by his biographers
that he had agents for the sale of his books in every
city of Christendom. Wynkyn de Worde, who succeeded to
Caxton&rsquo;s press in Westminster, had a shop in Fleet Street.</p>

<p>The religious dissensions of the continent, and the Reformation
in England under Henry VIII. and Edward VI., created a
great demand for books; but in England neither Tudor nor
Stuart could tolerate a free press, and various efforts were made
to curb it. The first patent for the office of king&rsquo;s printer was
granted to Thomas Berthelet by Henry VIII. in 1529, but only
such books as were first licensed were to be printed. At that
time even the purchase or possession of an unlicensed book was
a punishable offence. In 1556 the Company of Stationers was
incorporated, and very extensive powers were granted in order
that obnoxious books might be repressed. In the following
reigns the Star Chamber exercised a pretty effectual censorship;
but, in spite of all precaution, such was the demand for books
of a polemical nature, that many were printed abroad and
surreptitiously introduced into England. Queen Elizabeth interfered
but little with books except when they emanated from
Roman Catholics, or touched upon her royal prerogatives; and
towards the end of her reign, and during that of her pedantic
successor, James, bookselling flourished. Archbishop Laud, who
was no friend to booksellers, introduced many arbitrary restrictions;
but they were all, or nearly all, removed during the time of
the Commonwealth. So much had bookselling increased during
the Protectorate that, in 1658, was published <i>A Catalogue of the
most Vendible Books in England, digested under the heads of Divinity,
History, Physic, &amp;c., with School Books, Hebrew, Greek and Latin,
and an Introduction, for the use of Schools</i>, by W. London. A bad
time immediately followed. The Restoration also restored the
office of Licenser of the Press, which continued till 1694.</p>

<p>In the first English Copyright Act (1709), which specially relates
to booksellers, it is enacted that, if any person shall think the
published price of a book unreasonably high, he may thereupon
make complaint to the archbishop of Canterbury, and to certain
other persons named, who shall thereupon examine into his
complaint, and if well founded reduce the price; and any
bookseller charging more than the price so fixed shall be fined
£5 for every copy sold. Apparently this enactment remained a
dead letter.</p>

<p>For later times it is necessary to make a gradual distinction
between <i>booksellers</i>, whose trade consists in selling books, either
by retail or wholesale, and <i>publishers</i>, whose business involves
the production of the books from the author&rsquo;s manuscripts, and
who are the intermediaries between author and bookseller, just
as the booksellers (in the restricted sense) are intermediaries
between the author and publisher and the public. The article
on <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Publishing</a></span> (<i>q.v.</i>) deals more particularly with this second
class, who, though originally booksellers, gradually took a higher
rank in the book-trade, and whose influence upon the history
of literature has often been very great. The convenience of this
distinction is not impaired by the fact either that a publisher
is also a wholesale bookseller, or that a still more recent development
in publishing (as in the instance of the direct sale in 1902,
by the London <i>Times</i>, of the supplementary volumes to the 9th
edition of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, which were also &ldquo;published&rdquo;
by <i>The Times</i>) started a reaction to some extent in the
way of amalgamating the two functions. The scheme of <i>The
Times</i> Book Club (started in 1905) was, again, a combination
of a subscription library with the business of bookselling (see
NEWSPAPERS); and it brought the organization of a newspaper,
with all its means of achieving publicity, into the work of pushing
the sale of books, in a way which practically introduced a new
factor into the bookselling business.</p>

<p>During the 19th century it remains the fact that the distinction
between publisher and bookseller&mdash;literary promoter and shopkeeper&mdash;became
fundamental. The booksellers, as such, were
engaged either in wholesale bookselling, or in the retail, the old or
second-hand, and the periodical trades.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Coming between the publisher and the retail bookseller is the
important distributing agency of the <i>wholesale bookseller</i>. It is to
him that the retailer looks for his miscellaneous supplies, as it is
simply impossible for him to stock one-half of the books published.
In Paternoster Row, London, which has for over a hundred years
been the centre of this industry, may be seen the collectors from the
shops of the retail booksellers, busily engaged in obtaining the books
ordered by the book-buying public. It is also through these agencies
that the country bookseller obtains his miscellaneous supplies. At
the leading house in this department of bookselling almost any book
can be found, or information obtained concerning it. At one of these
establishments over 1,000,000 books are constantly kept in stock.
It is here that the publisher calls first on showing or &ldquo;subscribing&rdquo;
a new book, a critical process, for by the number thus subscribed
the fate of a book is sometimes determined.</p>

<p>What may be termed the third partner in publishing and its
ramification is the <i>retail bookseller</i>; and to protect his interests there
was established in 1890 a London booksellers&rsquo; society, which had for
its object the restriction of discounts to 25%, and also to arrange
prices generally and control all details connected with the trade.
The society a few years afterwards widened its field of operations so
as to include the whole of the United Kingdom, and its designation
then became &ldquo;The Associated Booksellers of Great Britain and
Ireland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trade in old or (as they are sometimes called) second-hand books
is in a sense, no doubt, a higher class of business, requiring a knowledge
of bibliography, while the transactions are with individual
books rather than with numbers of copies. Occasionally dealers in
this class of books replenish their stocks by purchasing remainders
of books, which, having ceased from one cause or another to sell with
the publisher, they offer to the public as bargains. The periodical
trade grew up during the 19th century, and was in its infancy when
the <i>Penny Magazine</i>, <i>Chambers&rsquo;s Journal</i>, and similar publications
first appeared. The growth of this important part of the business
was greatly promoted by the abolition of the newspaper stamp and
of the duty upon paper, the introduction of attractive illustrations,
and the facilities offered for purchasing books by instalments.</p>
</div>

<p>The history of bookselling in America has a special interest.
The Spanish settlements drew away from the old country much
of its enterprise and best talent, and the presses of Mexico
and other cities teemed with publications mostly of a religious
character, but many others, especially linguistic and historical,
were also published. Bookselling in the United States was of a
somewhat later growth, although printing was introduced into
Boston as early as 1676, Philadelphia in 1685, and New York
in 1693. Franklin had served to make the trade illustrious,
yet few persons were engaged in it at the commencement of
the 19th century. Books chiefly for scholars and libraries were
imported from Europe; but after the second war printing-presses
multiplied rapidly, and with the spread of newspapers
and education there also arose a demand for books, and publishers
set to work to secure the advantages offered by the wide field
of English literature, the whole of which they had the liberty of
reaping free of all cost beyond that of production. The works of
Scott, Byron, Moore, Southey, Wordsworth, and indeed of every
author of note, were reprinted without the smallest payment to
author or proprietor. Half the names of the authors in the so-called
&ldquo;American&rdquo; catalogue of books printed between 1820
and 1852 are British. By this means the works of the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>
authors were brought to the doors of all classes in the cheapest
variety of forms. In consequence of the Civil War, the high
price of labour, and the restrictive duties laid on in order to
protect native industry, coupled with the frequent intercourse
with England, a great change took place, and American publishers
and booksellers, while there was still no international copyright,
made liberal offers for early sheets of new publications. Boston,
New York and Philadelphia still retained their old supremacy
as bookselling centres. Meanwhile, the distinct publishing business
also grew, till gradually the conditions of business became
assimilated to those of Europe.</p>

<p>In the course of the 16th and 17th centuries the Low Countries
for a time became the chief centre of the bookselling world, and
many of the finest folios and quartos in our libraries bear the
names of Jansen, Blauw or Plantin, with the imprint of Amsterdam,
Utrecht, Leiden or Antwerp, while the Elzevirs besides
other works produced their charming little pocket classics. The
southern towns of Douai and St Omer at the same time furnished
polemical works in English.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Publishing</a></span> are noticed various further developments of
this subject. Much interesting information on the history of the
book trade will be found in Charles Knight&rsquo;s <i>Biography of William
Caxton</i>, and in the same author&rsquo;s <i>Shadows of the Old Booksellers</i>
(1865). See also Henry Curwen, <i>History of Booksellers</i> (1873); and

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOOLE, GEORGE<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> (1815-1864), English logician and mathematician,
was born in Lincoln on the 2nd of November 1815.
His father was a tradesman of limited means, but of studious
character and active mind. Being especially interested in
mathematical science, the father gave his son his first lessons;
but the extraordinary mathematical powers of George Boole
did not manifest themselves in early life. At first his favourite
subject was classics. Not until the age of seventeen did he attack
the higher mathematics, and his progress was much retarded by
the want of efficient help. When about sixteen years of age he
became assistant-master in a private school at Doncaster, and
he maintained himself to the end of his life in one grade or other
of the scholastic profession. Few distinguished men, indeed,
have had a less eventful life. Almost the only changes which
can be called events are his successful establishment of a school
at Lincoln, its removal to Waddington, his appointment in
1849 as professor of mathematics in the Queen&rsquo;s College at
Cork, and his marriage in 1855 to Miss Mary Everest, who, as
Mrs Boole, afterwards wrote several useful educational works on
her husband&rsquo;s principles.</p>

<p>To the public Boole was known only as the author of numerous
abstruse papers on mathematical topics, and of three or four
distinct publications which have become standard works. His
earliest published paper was one upon the &ldquo;Theory of Analytical
Transformations,&rdquo; printed in the <i>Cambridge Mathematical
Journal</i> for 1839, and it led to a friendship between Boole and
D.F. Gregory, the editor of the journal, which lasted until the
premature death of the latter in 1844. A long list of Boole&rsquo;s
memoirs and detached papers, both on logical and mathematical
topics, will be found in the <i>Catalogue of Scientific Memoirs</i> published
by the Royal Society, and in the supplementary volume
on <i>Differential Equations</i>, edited by Isaac Todhunter. To the
<i>Cambridge Mathematical Journal</i> and its successor, the <i>Cambridge
and Dublin Mathematical Journal</i>, Boole contributed in all
twenty-two articles. In the third and fourth series of the <i>Philosophical
Magazine</i> will be found sixteen papers. The Royal
Society printed six important memoirs in the <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i>, and a few other memoirs are to be found in the
<i>Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh</i> and of the <i>Royal
Irish Academy</i>, in the <i>Bulletin de l&rsquo;Académie de St-Pétersbourg</i>
for 1862 (under the name G. Boldt, vol. iv. pp. 198-215), and
in <i>Crelle&rsquo;s Journal</i>. To these lists should be added a paper on
the mathematical basis of logic, published in the <i>Mechanic&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> for 1848. The works of Boole are thus contained in
about fifty scattered articles and a few separate publications.</p>

<p>Only two systematic treatises on mathematical subjects were
completed by Boole during his lifetime. The well-known
<i>Treatise on Differential Equations</i> appeared in 1859, and was
followed, the next year, by a <i>Treatise on the Calculus of Finite
Differences</i>, designed to serve as a sequel to the former work.
These treatises are valuable contributions to the important
branches of mathematics in question, and Boole, in composing
them, seems to have combined elementary exposition with the
profound investigation of the philosophy of the subject in a
manner hardly admitting of improvement. To a certain extent
these works embody the more important discoveries of their
author. In the 16th and 17th chapters of the <i>Differential
Equations</i> we find, for instance, a lucid account of the general
symbolic method, the bold and skilful employment of which led
to Boole&rsquo;s chief discoveries, and of a general method in analysis,
originally described in his famous memoir printed in the <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i> for 1844. Boole was one of the most eminent
of those who perceived that the symbols of operation could be
separated from those of quantity and treated as distinct objects
of calculation. His principal characteristic was perfect confidence
in any result obtained by the treatment of symbols in
accordance with their primary laws and conditions, and an
almost unrivalled skill and power in tracing out these results.</p>

<p>During the last few years of his life Boole was constantly
engaged in extending his researches with the object of producing
a second edition of his <i>Differential Equations</i> much more complete
than the first edition; and part of his last vacation was spent in
the libraries of the Royal Society and the British Museum.
But this new edition was never completed. Even the manuscripts
left at his death were so incomplete that Todhunter,
into whose hands they were put, found it impossible to use them
in the publication of a second edition of the original treatise,
and wisely printed them, in 1865, in a supplementary volume.</p>

<p>With the exception of Augustus de Morgan, Boole was probably
the first English mathematician since the time of John Wallis
who had also written upon logic. His novel views of logical
method were due to the same profound confidence in symbolic
reasoning to which he had successfully trusted in mathematical
investigation. Speculations concerning a calculus of reasoning
had at different times occupied Boole&rsquo;s thoughts, but it was not
till the spring of 1847 that he put his ideas into the pamphlet
called <i>Mathematical Analysis of Logic</i>. Boole afterwards regarded
this as a hasty and imperfect exposition of his logical system,
and he desired that his much larger work, <i>An Investigation of the
Laws of Thought, on which are founded the Mathematical Theories
of Logic and Probabilities</i> (1854), should alone be considered as
containing a mature statement of his views. Nevertheless,
there is a charm of originality about his earlier logical work
which no competent reader can fail to appreciate. He did not
regard logic as a branch of mathematics, as the title of his earlier
pamphlet might be taken to imply, but he pointed out such a
deep analogy between the symbols of algebra and those which
can be made, in his opinion, to represent logical forms and
syllogisms, that we can hardly help saying that logic is mathematics
restricted to the two quantities, 0 and 1. By unity Boole
denoted the universe of thinkable objects; literal symbols,
such as <i>x, y, z, v, u</i>, &amp;c., were used with the elective meaning
attaching to common adjectives and substantives. Thus, if
x = horned and y = sheep, then the successive acts of election
represented by x and y, if performed on unity, give the whole of
the class <i>horned sheep</i>. Boole showed that elective symbols of
this kind obey the same primary laws of combination as algebraical
symbols, whence it followed that they could be added,
subtracted, multiplied and even divided, almost exactly in
the same manner as numbers. Thus, 1 &minus; x would represent the
operation of selecting all things in the world except <i>horned things</i>,
that is, <i>all not horned things</i>, and (1 &minus; x)(1 &minus; y) would give us <i>all
things neither horned nor sheep</i>. By the use of such symbols
propositions could be reduced to the form of equations, and
the syllogistic conclusion from two premises was obtained by
eliminating the middle term according to ordinary algebraic
rules.</p>

<p>Still more original and remarkable, however, was that part
of his system, fully stated in his <i>Laws of Thought</i>, which formed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span>
a general symbolic method of logical inference. Given any
propositions involving any number of terms, Boole showed how,
by the purely symbolic treatment of the premises, to draw any
conclusion logically contained in those premises. The second
part of the <i>Laws of Thought</i> contained a corresponding attempt
to discover a general method in probabilities, which should
enable us from the given probabilities of any system of events to
determine the consequent probability of any other event logically
connected with the given events.</p>

<p>Though Boole published little except his mathematical and
logical works, his acquaintance with general literature was wide
and deep. Dante was his favourite poet, and he preferred the
<i>Paradiso</i> to the <i>Inferno</i>. The metaphysics of Aristotle, the ethics
of Spinoza, the philosophical works of Cicero, and many kindred
works, were also frequent subjects of study. His reflections upon
scientific, philosophical and religious questions are contained in
four addresses upon <i>The Genius of Sir Isaac Newton</i>, <i>The Right
Use of Leisure</i>, <i>The Claims of Science</i> and <i>The Social Aspect of
Intellectual Culture</i>, which he delivered and printed at different
times.</p>

<p>The personal character of Boole inspired all his friends with
the deepest esteem. He was marked by the modesty of true
genius, and his life was given to the single-minded pursuit of
truth. Though he received a medal from the Royal Society for
his memoir of 1844, and the honorary degree of LL.D. from the
university of Dublin, he neither sought nor received the ordinary
rewards to which his discoveries would entitle him. On the 8th
of December 1864, in the full vigour of his intellectual powers, he
died of an attack of fever, ending in suffusion on the lungs.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOOM,<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> a word of Teutonic origin (cf. the Ger. <i>Baum</i>, tree,
and the Eng. <i>beam</i>) for a pole, bar or barrier, used especially as a
nautical term, for a long spar, used to extend a sail at the foot
(main-boom, jib-boom, &amp;c.). The &ldquo;boom&rdquo; of a cannon (note of
a bell, cry of the bittern) is distinct from this, being onomatopoeic.
In the sense of a barrier, a boom is generally formed of timber
lashed together, or of chains, built across the mouth of a river
or harbour as a means of defence. Possibly from the metaphor
of a breaking boom, and the accompanying rush and roar, or from
the rush of rising waters (mingled with the onomatopoeic use),
&ldquo;boom&rdquo; began in America to be used of a sudden &ldquo;spurt&rdquo; or
access of industrial activity, as in the phrase &ldquo;a boom in cotton.&rdquo;
Hence the verb &ldquo;to boom,&rdquo; meaning to advertise or push into
public favour.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOOMERANG,<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> a missile weapon of the Australian aborigines
and other peoples. The word is taken from the native name
used by a single tribe in New South Wales, and was mentioned in
1827 by Captain King as &ldquo;the Port Jackson term&rdquo; (<i>Nav. Surv.
Coasts Austral.</i> i. 355) It has been erroneously connected with
the <i>womera</i> or spear-thrower, and equally erroneously regarded
as onomatopoeic&mdash;for it does not &ldquo;boom&rdquo; but whistles in the air.
Two main types may be distinguished: (<i>a</i>) the return boomerang;
(<i>b</i>) the non-return or war boomerang. Both types are found in
most parts of Australia; the return form was, according to
General Pitt-Rivers, used in ancient Egypt; and a weapon
which has a close resemblance to the boomerang survives to
the present day in North-East Africa, whence it has spread in
allied forms made of metal (throwing knives). Among the
Dravidians of South India is found a boomerang-shaped instrument
which can be made to return. It is, however, still uncertain
whether the so-called boomerangs of Egypt and India have any
real resemblance to the Australian return boomerang. The
Hopis (Moquis) of Arizona use a non-return form. The general
form of both weapons is the same. They are sickle-shaped, and
made of wood (in India of ivory or steel), so modelled that the
thickness is about <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">6</span>th of the breadth, which again is <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">12</span>th of
the length, the last varying from 6 in. to 3 or 4 ft. The return
boomerang, which may have two straight arms at an angle of
from 70° to 120°, but in Australia is always curved at an angle of
90° or more, is usually 2 to 3 ft. in length and weighs some 8 oz.;
the arms have a skew, being twisted 2° or 3° from the plane
running through the centre of the weapon, so that B and D (fig. 1)
are above it, A and E below it; the ends AB and DE are also
to some extent raised above the plane of the weapon at C; the
cross section is asymmetrical, the upper side in the figure being
convex, the lower flat or nearly so;
this must be thrown with the right
hand. The non-return boomerang
has a skew in the opposite direction
but is otherwise similar.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 270px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:218px; height:92px" src="images/img236a.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 1.</td></tr></table>

<p>The peculiarity of the boomerang&rsquo;s
flight depends mainly on its
skew. The return boomerang is held vertically, the concave
side forward, and thrown in a plane parallel to the surface of
the ground, as much rotation as possible being imparted to it.
It travels straight for 30 yds. or more, with nearly vertical rotation;
then it inclines to the left, lying over on the flat side and
rising in the air; after describing a circle of 50 or more yards in
diameter it returns to the thrower. Some observers state that it
returns after striking the object; it is certainly possible to strike
the ground without affecting the return. Throws of 100 yds. or
more, before the leftward curve begins, can be accomplished by
Australian natives, the weapon rising as much as 150 ft. in the
air and circling five times before returning. The non-return type
may also be made to return in a nearly straight line by throwing
it at an angle of 45°, but normally it is thrown like the return
type, and will then travel an immense distance. No accurate
measurements of Australian throws are available, but an English
throw of 180 yds. has been recorded, compared with the same
thrower&rsquo;s 70 yds. with the cricket ball.</p>

<td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Flight in Vertical Plane.</td></tr></table>

<p>The war boomerang in an expert&rsquo;s hand is a deadly weapon,
and the lighter hunting boomerang is also effective. The
return boomerang is chiefly used as a plaything or for killing
birds, and is often as dangerous to the thrower as to the object
at which it is aimed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOONE, DANIEL<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span> (1734-1820), American pioneer and backwoodsman,
of English descent, was born near the present city
of Reading, Pennsylvania, on the 2nd of November (N.S.) 1734.
About 1751 his father, Squire Boone, with his family settled in
the Yadkin Valley in what is now Davie county, North Carolina,
then on the frontier. Daniel worked on his father&rsquo;s farm, and
spent much of his time hunting and trapping. In 1755 he served
as a wagoner and blacksmith in Braddock&rsquo;s disastrous expedition
against the Indians. In 1765 he visited Florida, and in 1767
he first visited the Kentucky region. With several companions,
including John Finley, who had been there as early as 1752, he
spent two years, 1769-1771, roaming about what is now Kentucky,
meeting with numberless adventures, coming in conflict with
roving bands of Indians, and collecting bear, beaver and deer
skins. He served in Lord Dunmore&rsquo;s War (1774), and in 1775
led to Kentucky the party of settlers who founded Boonesborough,
long an important settlement. On the 7th of February 1778 he,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>237</span>
and the party he led, were captured by a band of Shawnees.
He was adopted into the Shawnee tribe, was taken to Detroit,
and on the return from that place escaped, reaching Boonesborough,
after a perilous journey of 160 m., within four days, in
time to give warning of a formidable attack by his captors. In
repelling this attack, which lasted from the 8th to the 17th of
September, he bore a conspicuous part. He also took part in
the sanguinary &ldquo;Battle of Blue Licks&rdquo; in 1782. For a time
he represented the settlers in the Virginia legislature (Kentucky
then being a part of Virginia), and he also served as deputy
surveyor, sheriff and county lieutenant of Fayette county, one
of the three counties into which Kentucky was then divided.
Having lost all his land through his carelessness in regard to
titles, he removed in 1788 to Point Pleasant, Virginia (now
W. Va.), whence about 1799 he removed to a place in what is
now Missouri, about 45 m. west of St Louis, in territory then
owned by Spain. He received a grant of 1000 arpents (about
845 acres) of land, and was appointed syndic of the district.
After the United States gained possession of &ldquo;Louisiana&rdquo; in
1803, Boone&rsquo;s title was found to be defective, and he was again
dispossessed. He died on the 22nd of September 1820, and in
1845 his remains were removed to Frankfort, Kentucky, where
a monument has been erected to his memory. Boone was a
typical American pioneer and backwoodsman, a great hunter
and trapper, highly skilled in all the arts of woodcraft, familiar
with the Indians and their methods of warfare, a famous Indian
fighter, restless, resourceful and fearless. His services, however,
have been greatly over-estimated, and he was not, as is popularly
believed, either the first to explore or the first to settle the
Kentucky region.</p>

census) 9500 (1334 foreign-born); (1910) 10,347. It is served
by the Chicago &amp; North-Western (which has construction and
repair shops here), the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St Paul
railways, and by the Fort Dodge, Des Moines &amp; Southern
(inter-urban) railway, which connects with Des Moines, Ames,
&amp;c. Boone is an important coal centre; bricks and tiles are
manufactured from the clay obtained near by; there is a
packing plant for the manufacture of beef and pork products;
and from the rich farming section by which the city is surrounded
come large quantities of grain, some of which is milled here,
and live-stock. Boone was laid out in 1865, was incorporated as
a town in 1866, and was chartered as a city in 1868.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOONVILLE,<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Cooper county,

210 m. W. by N. of St Louis. Pop. (1890) 4141; (1900) 4377,
including 1111 negroes; (1910) 4252. It is served by the Missouri
Pacific, and the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas railways. The city
lies along a bluff about 100 ft. above the river. It is the seat of
the Missouri training school for boys (1889), and of the Kemper
military school (1844). Among its manufactures are earthenware,
tobacco, vinegar, flour, farm-gates (iron), sash and doors,
marble and granite monuments, carriages and bricks. Iron,
zinc and lead are found in the vicinity, and some coal is mined.
Boonville, named in honour of Daniel Boone, was settled in
1810, was laid out in 1817, incorporated as a village in 1839,
and chartered as a city of the third class in 1896. Here on the
17th of June 1861, Captain (Major-General) Nathaniel Lyon,
commanding about 2000 Union troops, defeated a slightly
larger, but undisciplined Confederate force under Brigadier-General
John S. Marmaduke. David Barton (d. 1837), one of the
first two United States senators from Missouri, was buried here.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOORDE<a name="ar144" id="ar144"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Borde</span>), <span class="bold">ANDREW</span> (1490?-1549), English
physician and author, was born at Boord&rsquo;s Hill, Holms Dale,
Sussex. He was educated at Oxford, and was admitted a
member of the Carthusian order while under age. In 1521 he
was &ldquo;dispensed from religion&rdquo; in order that he might act as
suffragan bishop of Chichester, though he never actually filled
the office, and in 1529 he was freed from his monastic vows, not
being able to endure, as he said, the &ldquo;rugorosite off your relygyon.&rdquo;
He then went abroad to study medicine, and on his
return was summoned to attend the duke of Norfolk. He
subsequently visited the universities of Orleans, Poitiers,
Toulouse, Montpellier and Wittenberg, saw the practice of
surgery at Rome, and went on pilgrimage with others of his
nation to Compostella in Navarre. In 1534 Boorde was again
in London at the Charterhouse, and in 1536 wrote to Thomas
Cromwell, complaining that he was in &ldquo;thraldom&rdquo; there.
Cromwell set him at liberty, and after entertaining him at his
house at Bishops Waltham in Hampshire, seems to have entrusted
him with a mission to find out the state of public feeling abroad
with regard to the English king. He writes to Cromwell from
various places, and from Catalonia he sends him the seeds of
rhubarb, two hundred years before that plant was generally
cultivated in England. Two letters in 1535 and 1536 to the prior
of the Charterhouse anxiously argue for his complete release
from monastic vows. In 1536 he was studying medicine at
Glasgow and gathering his observations about the Scots and the
&ldquo;devellyshe dysposicion of a Scottysh man, not to love nor
favour an Englishe man.&rdquo; About 1538 Boorde set out on his
most extensive journey, visiting nearly all the countries of
Europe except Russia and Turkey, and making his way to
Jerusalem. Of these travels he wrote a full itinerary, lost unfortunately
by Cromwell, to whom it was sent. He finally
settled at Montpellier and before 1542 had completed his <i>Fyrst
Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge</i>, which ranks as the earliest
continental guide book, his <i>Dietary</i> and his <i>Brevyary</i>. He
probably returned to England in 1542, and lived at Winchester
and perhaps at Pevensey. John Ponet, bishop of Winchester,
in an <i>Apology</i> against Bishop Gardiner, relates as matter of
common knowledge that in 1547 Doctor Boord, a physician and
a holy man, who still kept the Carthusian rules of fasting and
wearing a hair shirt, was convicted in Winchester of keeping in
his house three loose women. For this offence, apparently, he
was imprisoned in the Fleet, where he made his will on the 9th of
April 1549. It was proved on the 25th of the same month.
Thomas Hearne (<i>Benedictus Abbas</i>, i, p. 52) says that he went
round like a quack doctor to country fairs, and therefore rashly
supposed him to have been the original merry-andrew.</p>

<p>Andrew Boorde was no doubt a learned physician, and he has
left two amusing and often sensible works on domestic hygiene
and medicine, but his most entertaining book is <i>The Fyrst Boke
of the Introduction of Knowledge. The whyche dothe teache a man
to speake parte of all maner of languages, and to know the usage and
fashion of all maner of countreys. And for to know the moste parte

region. Made by Andrew Borde, of Physycke Doctor. Dedycated
to the right honourable, and gracious lady Mary daughter of our
soverayne Lorde Kyng Henry the eyght</i> (<i>c</i>. 1547). The Englishman
describes himself and his foibles&mdash;his fickleness, his fondness for
new fashions and his obstinacy&mdash;in lively verse. Then follows
a geographical description of the country, followed by a model
dialogue in the Cornish language. Each country in turn is dealt
with on similar lines. His other authentic works are: <i>Here
foloweth a Compendyous Regimente or Dyetary of health, made in
Mountpyllor</i> (Thomas Colwell, 1562), of which there are undated
and doubtless earlier editions; <i>The Brevyary of Health</i> (1547?);
<i>The Princyples of Astronamy</i> (1547?); &ldquo;The Peregrination of
Doctor Board,&rdquo; printed by Thomas Hearne in <i>Benedictus Abbas
Petroburgensis</i>, vol. ii. (1735); <i>A Pronostycacyon or an Almanacke
for the yere of our lorde MCCCCCXLV. made by Andrew Boorde</i>.
His <i>Itinerary of Europe</i> and <i>Treatyse upon Berdes</i> are lost.
Several jest-books are attributed to him without authority&mdash;<i>The
Merie Tales of the Mad Men of Gotam</i> (earliest extant edition,
1630), <i>Scogin&rsquo;s Jests</i> (1626), <i>A mery jest of the Mylner of Abyngton,
with his wyfe, and his daughter, and of two poore scholers of Cambridge</i>

<p><span class="bold">BOOS, MARTIN<a name="ar145" id="ar145"></a></span> (1762-1825), German Roman Catholic theologian,
was born at Huttenried in Bavaria on the 25th of
December 1762. Orphaned at the age of four, he was reared by
an uncle at Augsburg, who finally sent him to the university of
Dillingen. There he laid the foundation of the modest piety by
which his whole life was distinguished. After serving as priest in
several Bavarian towns, he made his way in 1799 to Linz in
Austria, where he was welcomed by Bishop Gall, and set to work
first at Leonding and then at Waldneukirchen, becoming in 1806
pastor at Gallneukirchen. His pietistic movement won considerable
way among the Catholic laity, and even attracted some
fifty or sixty priests. The death of Gall and other powerful
friends, however, exposed him to bitter enmity and persecution
from about 1812, and he had to answer endless accusations in
the consistorial courts. His enemies followed him when he
returned to Bavaria, but in 1817 the Prussian government
appointed him to a professorship at Düsseldorf, and in 1819
gave him the pastorate at Sayn near Neuwied. He died on the
29th of August 1825.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOOT,<a name="ar146" id="ar146"></a></span> (1) (From the O. Eng. <i>bót</i>, a word common to Teutonic
languages, <i>e.g.</i> Goth, <i>bóta</i>, &ldquo;good, advantage,&rdquo; O.H.G. <i>Buoza</i>,
Mod. Ger. <i>Busse</i>, &ldquo;penance, fine&rdquo;; cf. &ldquo;better,&rdquo; the comparative
of &ldquo;good&rdquo;), profit or advantage. The word survives in
&ldquo;bootless,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> useless or unavailing, and in such expressions,
chiefly archaistic, as &ldquo;what boots it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Bote,&rdquo; an old form,
survives in some old compound legal words, such as &ldquo;house-bote,&rdquo;
&ldquo;fire-bote,&rdquo; &ldquo;hedge-bote,&rdquo; &amp;c., for particular rights of
&ldquo;estover,&rdquo; the Norman French word corresponding to the Saxon
&ldquo;bote&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Estovers</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Commons</a></span>). The same form survives
also in such expressions as &ldquo;thief-bote&rdquo; for the Old English
customary compensation paid for injuries.</p>

<p>(2) (A word of uncertain origin, which came into English
through the O. Fr. <i>bote</i>, modern <i>botte</i>; Med. Lat. <i>botta</i> or <i>bota</i>),
a covering for the foot. Properly a boot covers the whole lower
part of the leg, sometimes reaching to or above the knee, but in
common usage it is applied to one which reaches only above the
ankle, and is thus distinguished from &ldquo;shoe&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Costume</a></span> and
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Shoe</a></span>).</p>

<p>The &ldquo;boot&rdquo; of a coach has the same derivation. It was
originally applied to the fixed outside step, the French <i>botte</i>,
then to the uncovered spaces on or beside the step on which the
attendants sat facing sideways. Both senses are now obsolete,
the term now being applied to the covered receptacles under
the seats of the guard and coachman.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Boot, Boots</span> or <span class="sc">Bootikin</span> was an instrument of torture
formerly in use to extort confessions from suspected persons,
or obtain evidence from unwilling witnesses. It originated in
Scotland, but the date of its first use is unknown. It was certainly
frequently employed there in the latter years of the 16th century.
In a case of forgery in 1579 two witnesses, a clergyman and an
attorney, were so tortured. In a letter dated 1583 at the Record
Office in London, Walsingham instructs the English ambassador
at Edinburgh to have Father Holt, an English Jesuit, &ldquo;put to
the boots.&rdquo; It seems to have fallen into disuse after 1630, but
was revived in 1666 on the occasion of the Covenanters&rsquo; rebellion,
and was employed during the reigns of Charles II. and James II.
Upon the accession of William III. the Scottish convention
denounced &ldquo;the use of torture, without evidence and in ordinary
crimes, as contrary to law.&rdquo; However, a year or so later, one
Neville Payne, an Englishman suspected of treasonable motives
for visiting Scotland, was put to the torture under the authority
of a warrant signed by the king. This is the last recorded case
of its use, torture being finally abolished in Scotland in 1709.
It was not used in England after 1640. The boot was made of
iron or wood and iron fastened on the leg, between which and
the boot wedges were driven by blows from a mallet. After each
blow a question was put to the victim, and the ordeal was continued
until he gave the information or fainted. The wedges
were usually placed against the calf of the leg, but Bishop Burnet
says that they were sometimes put against the shin-bone. A
similar instrument, called &ldquo;Spanish boots,&rdquo; was used in Germany.
There were also iron boots which were heated on the victim&rsquo;s
foot. A less cruel form was a boot or buskin made wet and
drawn upon the legs and then dried with fire.</p>

of the northern hemisphere, mentioned by Eudoxus
(4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and Aratus (3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and perhaps
alluded to in the book of Job (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Arcturus</a></span>), and by Homer
and Hesiod. The ancient Greeks symbolized it as a man walking,
with his right hand grasping a club, and his left extending upwards
and holding the leash of two dogs, which are apparently
barking at the Great Bear. Ptolemy catalogues twenty-three
stars, Tycho Brahe twenty-eight, Hevelius fifty-two. In addition
to Arcturus, the brightest in the group, the most interesting
stars of this constellation are: &epsilon; <i>Boötis</i>, a beautiful double
star composed of a yellow star of magnitude 3, and a blue star
of magnitude 6½; &xi; <i>Boötis</i>, a double star composed of a yellow

<p><span class="bold">BOOTH, BARTON<a name="ar148" id="ar148"></a></span> (1681-1733), English actor, who came of a
good Lancashire family, was educated at Westminster school,
where his success in the Latin play <i>Andria</i> gave him an inclination
for the stage. He was intended for the church; but in 1698 he
ran away from Trinity College, Cambridge, and obtained employment
in a theatrical company in Dublin, where he made his
first appearance as Oroonoko. After two seasons in Ireland he
returned to London, where Betterton, who on an earlier application
had withheld his active aid, probably out of regard for
Booth&rsquo;s family, now gave him all the assistance in his power.
At Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields (1700-1704) he first appeared as Maximus
in <i>Valentinian</i>, and his success was immediate. He was at the
Haymarket with Betterton from 1705 to 1708, and for the next
twenty years at Drury Lane. Booth died on the 10th of May
1733, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. His greatest parts,
after the title-part of Addison&rsquo;s <i>Cato</i>, which established his
reputation as a tragedian, were probably Hotspur and Brutus.
His Lear was deemed worthy of comparison with Garrick&rsquo;s.
As the ghost in <i>Hamlet</i> he is said never to have had a superior.
Among his other Shakespearian rôles were Mark Antony, Timon
of Athens and Othello. He also played to perfection the gay
Lothario in Rowe&rsquo;s <i>Fair Penitent</i>. Booth was twice married;
his second wife, Hester Santlow, an actress of some merit,
survived him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOOTH, CHARLES<a name="ar149" id="ar149"></a></span> (1840-&emsp;&emsp;), English sociologist, was
born at Liverpool on the 30th of March 1840. In 1862 he became
a partner in Alfred Booth &amp; Company, a Liverpool firm engaged
in the Brazil trade, and subsequently chairman of the Booth
Steamship Company. He devoted much time, and no inconsiderable
sums of money, to inquiries into the statistical aspects
of social questions. The results of these are chiefly embodied
in a work entitled <i>Life and Labour of the People in London</i> (1891-1903),
of which the earlier portion appeared under the title of
<i>Life and Labour</i> in 1889. The book is designed to show &ldquo;the
numerical relation which poverty, misery and depravity bear
to regular earnings and comparative comfort, and to describe
the general conditions under which each class lives.&rdquo; It contains
a most striking series of maps, in which the varying degrees of
poverty are represented street by street, by shades of colour.
The data for the work were derived in part from the detailed
records kept by school-board &ldquo;visitors,&rdquo; partly from systematic
inquiries directed by Mr Booth himself, supplemented by
information derived from relieving officers and the Charity
Organization Society. Mr Booth also paid much attention
to a kindred subject&mdash;the lot of the aged poor. In 1894 he
published a volume of statistics on the subject, and, in 1891
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span>
and 1899, works on Old-age pensions, his scheme for the latter
depending on a general provision of pensions of five shillings
a week to all aged persons, irrespective of the cost to the state.
He married, in 1871, the daughter of Charles Zachary Macaulay.
In 1904 he was made a privy councillor.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOOTH, EDWIN [THOMAS]<a name="ar150" id="ar150"></a></span> (1833-1893), American actor,
was the second son of the actor Junius Brutus Booth, and was
born in Belair, Maryland, on the 13th of November 1833. His
father (1796-1852) was born in London on the 1st of May 1796,
and, after trying printing, law, painting and the sea, made his
first appearance on the stage in 1813, and appeared in London at
Covent Garden in 1815. He became almost at once a great
favourite, and a rival of Kean, whom he was thought to resemble.
To Kean&rsquo;s Othello nevertheless he played Iago on several
occasions. Richard III., Hamlet, King Lear, Shylock and Sir
Giles Overreach were his best parts, and in America, whither
he removed in 1821, they brought him great popularity. His
eccentricities sometimes bordered on insanity, and his excited and
furious fencing as Richard III. and as Hamlet frequently compelled
the Richmond and Laertes to fight for their lives in deadly
earnest.</p>

<p>Edwin Booth&rsquo;s first regular appearance was at the Boston
Museum on the 10th of September 1849, as Tressel to his father&rsquo;s
Richard, in Colley Cibber&rsquo;s version of <i>Richard III.</i> He was
lithe and graceful in figure, buoyant in spirits; his dark hair
fell in waving curls across his brow, and his eyes were soft,
luminous and most expressive. His father watched him with
great interest, but with evident disappointment, and the members
of the theatrical profession, who held the acting of the elder
Booth in great reverence, seemed to agree that the genius of the
father had not descended to the son. Edwin Booth&rsquo;s first appearance
in New York was in the character of Wilford in <i>The
Iron Chest</i>, which he played at the National theatre in Chatham
Street, on the 27th of September 1850. A year later, on the
illness of the father, the son took his place in the character of
Richard III. It was not until after his parent&rsquo;s death that
the son conquered for himself an unassailable position on the
stage. Between 1852 and 1856 he played in California, Australia
and the Sandwich Islands, and those who had known him in the
east were surprised when the news came that he had captivated
his audiences with his brilliant acting. From this time forward
his dramatic triumphs were warmly acknowledged. His
Hamlet, Richard and Richelieu were pronounced to be superior
to the performances of Edwin Forrest; his success as Sir Giles
Overreach in <i>A New Way to Pay Old Debts</i> surpassed his father&rsquo;s.
In 1862 he became manager of the Winter Garden theatre, New
York, where he gave a series of Shakespearian productions of
then unexampled magnificence (1864-1867), including <i>Hamlet</i>,
<i>Othello</i> and <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>. The splendour of this
period in his career was dashed for many months when in 1865
his brother, John Wilkes Booth, assassinated President Lincoln
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lincoln, Abraham</a></span>). The three Booth brothers, Junius
Brutus (1821-1853), Edwin and John Wilkes (1839-1865), had
played together in <i>Julius Caesar</i> in the autumn of the previous
year&mdash;the performance being memorable both for its own
excellence, and for the tragic situation into which two of the
principal performers were subsequently hurled by the crime of
the third. Edwin Booth did not reappear on the stage until
the 3rd of January 1866, when he played Hamlet at the Winter
Garden theatre, the audience showing by unstinted applause
their conviction that the glory of the one brother would never
be imperilled by the infamy of the other.</p>

<p>In 1868-1869 Edwin Booth built a theatre of his own&mdash;Booth&rsquo;s
theatre, at the corner of 23rd Street and 6th Avenue, New York&mdash;and
organized an excellent stock company, which produced <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i>, <i>The Winter&rsquo;s Tale</i>, <i>Julius Caesar</i>, <i>Macbeth</i>, <i>Much Ado
about Nothing</i>, <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> and other plays. In all cases
Booth used the true text of Shakespeare, thus antedating by many
years a similar reform in England. Almost invariably his ventures
were successful, but he was of a generous and confiding nature, and
his management was not economical. In 1874 the grand dramatic
structure he had raised was taken from him, and with it went his
entire fortune. By arduous toil, however, he again accumulated
wealth, in the use of which his generous nature was shown. He
converted his spacious residence in Gramercy Park, New York,
into a club&mdash;The Players&rsquo;&mdash;for the elect of his profession, and
for such members of other professions as they might choose.
The house, with all his books and works of art, and many invaluable
mementos of the stage, became the property of the
club. A single apartment he kept for himself. In this he died on
the 7th of June 1893. Among his parts were Macbeth, Lear,
Othello, Iago, Shylock, Wolsey, Richard II., Richard III.,
Benedick, Petruccio, Richelieu, Sir Giles Overreach, Brutus
(Payne&rsquo;s), Bertuccio (in Tom Taylor&rsquo;s <i>The Fool&rsquo;s Revenge</i>), Ruy
Blas, Don Cesar de Bazan, and many more. His most famous
part was Hamlet, for which his extraordinary grace and beauty
and his eloquent sensibility peculiarly fitted him. He probably
played the part oftener than any other actor before or since. He
visited London in 1851, and again in 1880 and in 1882, playing at
the Haymarket theatre with brilliant success. In the last year he
also visited Germany, where his acting was received with the
highest enthusiasm. His last appearance was in Brooklyn as
Hamlet in 1891. Booth was twice married: in 1860 to Mary
Devlin (d. 1863), and in 1869 to Mary F. McVicker (d. 1881). He
left by his first wife one daughter, Edwina Booth Grossman,
who published <i>Edwin Booth: Recollections</i> (New York, 1894).</p>

<p>Edwin Booth&rsquo;s prompt-books were edited by William Winter
(1878). In a series of volumes, <i>Actors and Actresses of Great Britain
and America</i>, edited by Lawrence Hutton and Brander Matthews,
Edwin Booth contributed recollections of his father, which contain
much valuable autobiographic material. For the same series

<p><span class="bold">BOOTH, WILLIAM<a name="ar151" id="ar151"></a></span> (1829-&emsp;&emsp;), founder and &ldquo;general&rdquo; of
the Salvation Army (<i>q.v.</i>), was born at Nottingham on the 10th
of April 1829. At the age of fifteen his mind took a strongly
religious turn, under the influence of the Wesleyan Methodists,
in which body he became a local preacher. In 1849 he came to
London, where, according to his own account, his passion for
open-air preaching caused his severance from the Wesleyans.
Joining the Methodist New Connexion, he was ordained a minister,
but, not being employed as he wished in active &ldquo;travelling
evangelization,&rdquo; left that body also in 1861. Meanwhile he had
(1855) married Miss Catherine Mumford, and had a family of
four children. Both he and his wife occupied themselves with
preaching, first in Cornwall and then in Cardiff and Walsall.
At the last-named place was first organized a &ldquo;Hallelujah band&rdquo;
of converted criminals and others, who testified in public of their
conversion. In 1864 Booth went to London and continued his
services in tents and in the open air, and founded a body which
was successively known as the East London Revival Society,
the East London Christian Mission, the Christian Mission and
(in 1878) the Salvation Army. The Army operates (1) by outdoor
meetings and processions; (2) by visiting public-houses, prisons,
private houses; (3) by holding meetings in theatres, factories
and other unusual buildings; (4) by using the most popular
song-tunes and the language of everyday life, &amp;c.; (5) by making
every convert a daily witness for Christ, both in public and private.
The army is a quasi-military organization, and Booth modelled
its &ldquo;Orders and Regulations&rdquo; on those of the British army.
Its early &ldquo;campaigns&rdquo; excited violent opposition, a &ldquo;Skeleton
Army&rdquo; being organized to break up the meetings, and for
many years Booth&rsquo;s followers were subjected to fine and imprisonment
as breakers of the peace. Since 1889, however,
these disorders have been little heard of. The operations of the
army were extended in 1880 to the United States, in 1881 to
Australia, and spread to the European continent, to India,
Ceylon and elsewhere, &ldquo;General&rdquo; Booth himself being an indefatigable
traveller, organizer and speaker. His wife (b. 1829)
died in 1890. By her preaching at Gateshead, where her husband
was circuit minister, in 1860, she began the women&rsquo;s ministry
which is so prominent a feature of the army&rsquo;s work. A biography
of her by Mr Booth Tucker appeared in 1892.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span></p>

<p>In 1890 &ldquo;General&rdquo; Booth attracted further public attention
by the publication of a work entitled <i>In Darkest England, and
the Way Out</i>, in which he proposed to remedy pauperism and vice
by a series of ten expedients: (1) the city colony; (2) the farm
colony; (3) the over-sea colony; (4) the household salvage
brigade; (5) the rescue homes for fallen women; (6) deliverance
for the drunkard; (7) the prison-gate brigade; (8) the poor
man&rsquo;s bank; (9) the poor man&rsquo;s lawyer; (10) Whitechapel-by-the-Sea.
Money was liberally subscribed and a large part of the
scheme was carried out. The opposition and ridicule with which
Booth&rsquo;s work was for many years received gave way, towards
the end of the 19th century, to very widespread sympathy as his
genius and its results were more fully realized.</p>

<p>The active encouragement of King Edward VII., at whose
instance in 1902 he was invited officially to be present at the
coronation ceremony, marked the completeness of the change;
and when, in 1905, the &ldquo;general&rdquo; went on a progress through
England, he was received in state by the mayors and corporations
of many towns. In the United States also, and elsewhere,
his work was cordially encouraged by the authorities.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOOTH<a name="ar152" id="ar152"></a></span> (connected with a Teutonic root meaning to dwell,
whence also &ldquo;bower&rdquo;), primarily a temporary dwelling of
boughs or other slight materials. Later the word gained the
special meaning of a market stall or any non-permanent erection,
such as a tent at a fair, where goods were on sale. Later still it
was applied to the temporary structure where votes were registered,
viz. polling-booth. Temporary booths erected for the
weekly markets naturally tended to become permanent shops.
Thus Stow states that the houses in Old Fish Street, London,
&ldquo;were at first but movable boards set out on market days to
show their fish there to be sold; but procuring licence to set up
sheds, they grew to shops, and by little and little, to tall houses.&rdquo;
As <i>bothy</i> or <i>bothie</i>, in Scotland, meaning generally a hut or
cottage, the word was specially applied to a barrack-like room
on large farms where the unmarried labourers were lodged.
This, known as the <i>Bothy system</i>, was formerly common in
Aberdeenshire and other parts of northern Scotland.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOOTHIA<a name="ar153" id="ar153"></a></span> (<i>Boothia Felix</i>), a peninsula of British North
America, belonging to Franklin district, and having an area of
13,100 sq. m., between 69° 30&prime; and 71° 50&prime; N. and 91° 30&prime; and
97° W. Its northernmost promontory, Murchison Point, is also
the northernmost point of the American mainland. It was discovered
by Captain (afterwards Sir James) Ross, during his
expedition of 1829-1833, and was named after Sir Felix Booth,
who had been chiefly instrumental in fitting out the expedition.
Boothia forms the western side of Boothia Gulf. From the main
mass of the continent the peninsula is almost separated by lakes
and inlets; and a narrow channel known as Bellot Strait intervenes
between it and North Somerset Island, which was discovered
by Sir E. Parry in 1819. The peninsula is not only
interesting for its connexion with the Franklin expedition and
the Franklin search, but is of scientific importance from the
north magnetic pole having been first distinctly localized here
by Ross, on the western side, in 70° 5&prime; N., 96° 47&prime; W.</p>

<p>Boothia Gulf separates the north-western portion of Baffin
Land and Melville Peninsula from Boothia Peninsula. It is
connected with Barrow Strait and Lancaster Sound by Prince
Regent Inlet, with Franklin Strait by Bellot Strait, and with
Fox Channel by Fury and Hecla Strait. The principal bays are
Committee and Pelly in the southern portion, and Lord Mayor
in the western.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOOTLE,<a name="ar154" id="ar154"></a></span> a municipal and county borough in the Bootle
parliamentary division of Lancashire, England; at the mouth
of the Mersey, forming a northern suburb of Liverpool. Pop.
(1901) 58,566; an increase by nearly nine times in forty years.
The great docks on this, the east bank of the Mersey, extend
into the borough, but are considered as a whole under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Liverpool</a></span>
(<i>q.v.</i>). Such features, moreover, as communications, water-supply,
&amp;c., may be considered as part of the greater systems of
the same city. The chief buildings and institutions are a handsome
town hall, a museum, free libraries, technical schools, and
several public pleasure grounds. Bootle was incorporated in
1868 and was created a county borough in 1888; the corporation
consists of a mayor, 10 aldermen and 30 councillors. A proposal
to include it within the city of Liverpool was rejected in parliament
in July 1903. Area, 1576 acres.</p>

cognate with Ger. <i>Beute</i> and Fr. <i>butin</i>), plunder or gain. The
phrase &ldquo;to play booty,&rdquo; dating from the 16th century, means to

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOPP, FRANZ<a name="ar156" id="ar156"></a></span> (1791-1867), German philologist, was born at
Mainz on the 14th of September 1791. In consequence of the
political troubles of that time, his parents removed to Aschaffenburg,
in Bavaria, where he received a liberal education at the
Lyceum. It was here that his attention was drawn to the
languages and literature of the East by the eloquent lectures of
Karl J. Windischmann, who, with G.F. Creuzer, J.J. Görres,
and the brothers Schlegel, was full of enthusiasm for Indian
wisdom and philosophy. And further, Fr. Schlegel&rsquo;s book,
<i>Über die Sprache und Weisheit der Indier</i> (Heidelberg, 1808),
which was just then exerting a powerful influence on the minds
of German philosophers and historians, could not fail to stimulate
also Bopp&rsquo;s interest in the sacred language of the Hindus. In
1812 he went to Paris at the expense of the Bavarian government,
with a view to devote himself vigorously to the study of Sanskrit.
There he enjoyed the society of such eminent men as A.L.
Chézy, S. de Sacy, L.M. Langlès, and, above all, of Alexander
Hamilton (1762-1824), who had acquired, when in India, an
acquaintance with Sanskrit, and had brought out, conjointly
with Langlès, a descriptive catalogue of the Sanskrit manuscripts
of the Imperial library. At that library Bopp had access not
only to the rich collection of Sanskrit manuscripts, most of
which had been brought from India by Father Pons early in the
18th century, but also to the Sanskrit books which had up to
that time issued from the Calcutta and Serampore presses. The
first fruit of his four years&rsquo; study in Paris appeared at Frankfort-On-Main
in 1816, under the title <i>Über das Conjugationssystem der
Sanskritsprache in Vergleichung mit jenem der griechischen,
lateinischen, persischen und germanischen Sprache</i>, and it was
accompanied with a preface from the pen of Windischmann.
In this first book Bopp entered at once on the path on which
the philological researches of his whole subsequent life were
concentrated. It was not that he wished to prove the common
parentage of Sanskrit with Persian, Greek, Latin and German,
for that had long been established; but his object was to trace
the common origin of their grammatical forms, of their inflections
from composition,&mdash;a task which had never been attempted.
By a historical analysis of those forms, as applied to the verb, he
furnished the first trustworthy materials for a history of the
languages compared.</p>

<p>After a brief sojourn in Germany, Bopp came to London,
where he made the acquaintance of Sir Charles Wilkins and H.T.
Colebrooke, and became the friend of Wilhelm von Humboldt,
then Prussian ambassador at the court of St James&rsquo;s, to whom
he gave instruction in Sanskrit. He brought out, in the <i>Annals
of Oriental Literature</i> (London, 1820), an essay entitled, &ldquo;Analytical
Comparison of the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin and Teutonic
Languages,&rdquo; in which he extended to all parts of the grammar
what he had done in his first book for the verb alone. He had
previously published a critical edition, with a Latin translation
and notes, of the story of <i>Nala and Damayant&#299;</i> (London, 1819),
the most beautiful episode of the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata. Other episodes of
the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata&mdash;<i>Indralok&#257;gamanam</i>, and three others (Berlin,
1824); <i>Diluvium</i>, and three others (Berlin, 1829); and a new edition
of <i>Nala</i> (Berlin, 1832)&mdash;followed in due course, all of which,
with A.W. Schlegel&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Bhagavadg&#299;t&#257;</i> (1823), proved
excellent aids in initiating the early student into the reading of
Sanskrit texts. On the publication, in Calcutta, of the whole Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata,
Bopp discontinued editing Sanskrit texts, and confined
himself thenceforth exclusively to grammatical investigations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span></p>

<p>After a short residence at Göttingen, Bopp was, on the recommendation
of Humboldt, appointed to the chair of Sanskrit and
comparative grammar at Berlin in 1821, and was elected member
of the Royal Prussian Academy in the following year. He
brought out, in 1827, his <i>Ausführliches Lehrgebäude der Sanskrita-Sprache</i>,
on which he had been engaged since 1821. A new
edition, in Latin, was commenced in the following year, and
completed in 1832; and a shorter grammar appeared in 1834.
At the same time he compiled a Sanskrit and Latin glossary
(1830) in which, more especially in the second and third editions
(1847 and 1867), account was also taken of the cognate languages.
His chief activity, however, centred on the elaboration of his
<i>Comparative Grammar</i>, which appeared in six parts at considerable
intervals (Berlin, 1833, 1835, 1842, 1847, 1849, 1852), under
the title <i>Vergleichende Grammatik des Sanskrit, Zend, Griechischen,
Lateinischen, Litthauischen, Altslavischen, Gothischen, und
Deutschen</i>. How carefully this work was matured may be
gathered from the series of monographs printed in the <i>Transactions
of the Berlin Academy</i> (1824 to 1831), by which it was
preceded. They bear the general title, <i>Vergleichende Zergliederung
des Sanskrits und der mit ihm verwandten Sprachen</i>. Two
other essays (on the &ldquo;Numerals,&rdquo; 1835) followed the publication
of the first part of the <i>Comparative Grammar</i>. The Old-Slavonian
began to take its stand among the languages compared from the
second part onwards. The work was translated into English by
E.B. Eastwick in 1845. A second German edition, thoroughly
revised (1856-1861), comprised also the Old-Armenian. From
this edition an excellent French translation was made by Professor
Michel Bréal in 1866. The task which Bopp endeavoured
to carry out in his <i>Comparative Grammar</i> was threefold,&mdash;to give
a description of the original grammatical structure of the
languages as deduced from their intercomparison, to trace their
phonetic laws, and to investigate the origin of their grammatical
forms. The first and second points were subservient to the third.
As Bopp&rsquo;s researches were based on the best available sources,
and incorporated every new item of information that came to
light, so they continued to widen and deepen in their progress.
Witness his monographs on the vowel system in the Teutonic
languages (1836), on the Celtic languages (1839), on the Old-Prussian
(1853) and Albanian languages (1854), on the accent in
Sanskrit and Greek (1854), on the relationship of the Malayo-Polynesian
with the Indo-European languages (1840), and on the
Caucasian languages (1846). In the two last mentioned the
impetus of his genius led him on a wrong track. Bopp has been
charged with neglecting the study of the native Sanskrit
grammars, but in those early days of Sanskrit studies the requisite
materials were not accessible in the great libraries of Europe;
and if they had been, they would have absorbed his exclusive
attention for years, while such grammars as those of Wilkins
and Colebrooke, from which his grammatical knowledge was
derived, were all based on native grammars. The further charge
that Bopp, in his <i>Comparative Grammar</i>, gave undue prominence
to Sanskrit may be disproved by his own words; for, as early as
the year 1820, he gave it as his opinion that frequently the
cognate languages serve to elucidate grammatical forms lost in
Sanskrit (<i>Annals of Or. Lit.</i> i. 3),&mdash;an opinion which he further
developed in all his subsequent writings.</p>

<p>Bopp&rsquo;s researches, carried with wonderful penetration into
the most minute and almost microscopical details of linguistic
phenomena, have led to the opening up of a wide and distant
view into the original seats, the closer or more distant affinity,
and the tenets, practices and domestic usages of the ancient
Indo-European nations, and the science of comparative grammar
may truly be said to date from his earliest publication. In
grateful recognition of that fact, on the fiftieth anniversary (May
16, 1866) of the date of Windischmann&rsquo;s preface to that work,
a fund called <i>Die Bopp-Stiftung</i>, for the promotion of the study
of Sanskrit and comparative grammar, was established at Berlin,
to which liberal contributions were made by his numerous pupils
and admirers in all parts of the globe. Bopp lived to see the
results of his labours everywhere accepted, and his name justly
celebrated. But he died, on the 23rd of October 1867, a poor
man,&mdash;though his genuine kindliness and unselfishness, his
devotion to his family and friends, and his rare modesty, endeared
him to all who knew him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BOPPARD,<a name="ar157" id="ar157"></a></span> a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine province,
on the left bank of the Rhine, 12 m. S. of Coblenz on the
mainline to Cologne. Pop. (1900) 5806. It is an old town still
partly surrounded by medieval walls, and its most noteworthy
buildings are the Roman Catholic parish church (12th and 13th
centuries); the Carmelite church (1318), the former castle, now
used for administrative offices; the Evangelical church (1851,
enlarged in 1887); and the former Benedictine motnastery of
the Marienberg, founded 1123 and since 1839 a hydropathic
establishment, crowning a hill 100 ft. above the Rhine. Boppard
is a favourite tourist centre, and being less pent in by hills than
many other places in this part of the picturesque gorge of the
Rhine, has in modern times become a residential town. It has
some comparatively insignificant industries, such as tanning and
tobacco manufacture; its direct trade is in wine and fruit.</p>

<p>Boppard (<i>Baudobriga</i>) was founded by the Romans; under
the Merovingian dynasty it became a royal residence. During
the middle ages it was a considerable centre of commerce and
shipping, and under the Hohenstaufen emperors was raised to
the rank of a free imperial city. In 1312, however, the emperor
Henry VII. pledged the town to his brother Baldwin, archbishop-elector
of Trier, and it remained in the possession of the electors
until it was absorbed by France during the Revolutionary epoch.
It was assigned by the congress of Vienna in 1815 to Prussia.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BORA,<a name="ar158" id="ar158"></a></span> an Italian name for a violent cold northerly and northeasterly
wind, common in the Adriatic, especially on the Istrian
and Dalmatian coasts. There is always a northern tendency in
the winds on the north Mediterranean shores in winter owing to
the cold air of the mountains sliding down to the sea where the
pressure is less. When, therefore, a cyclone is formed over the
Mediterranean, the currents in its north-western area draw
the air from the cold northern regions, and during the passage
of the cyclone the bora prevails. The bora also occurs at
Novorossiysk on the Black Sea. It is precisely similar in
character to the mistral which prevails in Provence and along
the French Mediterranean littoral.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BORACITE,<a name="ar159" id="ar159"></a></span> a mineral of special interest on account of its
optical anomalies. Small crystals bounded on all sides by
sharply defined faces are found in considerable numbers embedded
in gypsum and anhydrite in the salt deposits at Lüneburg in
Hanover, where it was first observed in 1787. In external form
these crystals are cubic with inclined hemihedrism, the symmetry
being the same as in blende and tetrahedrite. Their habit varies
according to whether the tetrahedron (fig. 1), the cube (fig. 2).
or the rhombic dodecahedron (fig. 3) predominates. Penetration
twins with a tetrahedron face as twin-plane are sometimes
observed. The crystals vary from translucent to transparent,
are possessed of a vitreous lustre, and are colourless or white,
though often tinged with grey, yellow or green. The hardness is
as high as 7 on Mohs&rsquo; scale; specific gravity 3.0. As first observed
by R.J. Haüy in 1791, the crystals are markedly pyroelectric;
a cube when heated becomes positively electrified on four of its
corners and negatively on the four opposite corners. In a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>
crystal such as represented in fig. 3, the smaller and dull tetrahedral
faces <i>s</i> are situated at the analogous poles (which become
positively electrified when the crystal is heated), and the larger
and bright tetrahedral faces <i>s&rsquo;</i> at the antilogous poles.</p>

<p>The characters so far enumerated are strictly in accordance
with cubic symmetry, but when a crystal is examined in polarized
light, it will be seen to be doubly refracting, as was first observed
by Sir David Brewster in 1821. Thin sections show twin-lamellae,
and a division into definite areas which are optically
biaxial. By cutting sections in suitable directions, it may be
proved that a rhombic dodecahedral crystal is really built up of
twelve orthorhombic pyramids, the apices of which meet in the
centre and the bases coincide with the dodecahedral faces of the
compound (pseudo-cubic) crystal. Crystals of other forms show
other types of internal structure. When the crystals are heated
these optical characters change, and at a temperature of 265°
the crystals suddenly become optically isotropic; on cooling,
however, the complexity of internal structure reappears. Various
explanations have been offered to account for these &ldquo;optical
anomalies&rdquo; of boracite. Some observers have attributed them
to alteration, others to internal strains in the crystals, which
originally grew as truly cubic at a temperature above 265°. It
would, however, appear that there are really two crystalline
modifications of the boracite substance, a cubic modification
stable above 265° and an orthorhombic (or monoclinic) one stable
at a lower temperature. This is strictly analogous to the case of
silver iodide, of which cubic and rhombohedral modifications
exist at different temperatures; but whereas rhombohedral as
well as pseudo-cubic crystals of silver iodide (iodyrite) are
known in nature, only pseudo-cubic crystals of boracite have as
yet been met with.</p>

<p>Chemically, boracite is a magnesium borate and chloride with
the formula Mg<span class="su">7</span>Cl<span class="su">2</span>B<span class="su">16</span>O<span class="su">30</span>&mdash;A small amount of iron is sometimes
present, and an iron-boracite with half the magnesium replaced
by ferrous iron has been called huyssenite. The mineral is insoluble
in water, but soluble in hydrochloric acid. On exposure
it is liable to slow alteration, owing to the absorption of water
by the magnesium chloride: an altered form is known as
parasite.</p>

<p>In addition to embedded crystals, a massive variety, known as
stassfurtite, occurs as nodules in the salt deposits at Stassfurt in
Prussia: that from the carnallite layer is compact, resembling
fine-grained marble, and white or greenish in colour, whilst that
from the kainite layer is soft and earthy, and yellowish or reddish
in colour.</p>

<i>borra</i>, rough hair), a herb (<i>Borago officinalis</i>) with bright blue
flowers and hairy leaves and stem, considered to have some
virtue as a cordial and a febrifuge; used as an ingredient in
salads or in making claret-cup, &amp;c.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BORAGINACEAE,<a name="ar161" id="ar161"></a></span> an order of plants belonging to the sympetalous
section of dicotyledons, and a member of the series
Tubiflorae. It is represented in Britain by bugloss (<i>Echium</i>)
(fig. 1), comfrey (<i>Symphytum</i>), <i>Myosotis</i>, hounds-tongue (<i>Cynoglossum</i>)
(fig. 2), and other genera, while borage (<i>Borago officinalis</i>)
(fig. 3) occurs as a garden escape in waste ground.
The plants are rough-haired annual or perennial herbs, more rarely
shrubby or arborescent, as in <i>Cordia</i> and <i>Ehretia</i>, which are
tropical or sub-tropical. The leaves, which are generally
alternate, are usually entire and narrow: the radical leaves in
some genera, as <i>Pulmonaria</i> (lungwort) and <i>Cynoglossum</i>, differ
in form from the stem-leaves, being generally broader and sometimes
heart-shaped. A characteristic feature is the one-sided
(<i>dorsiventral</i>) inflorescence, well illustrated in forget-me-not and
other species of <i>Myosotis</i>; the cyme is at first closely coiled,
becoming uncoiled as the flowers open. At the same time there
is often a change in colour in the flowers, which are red in bud,
becoming blue as they expand, as in <i>Myosotis, Echium, Symphytum</i>
and others. The flowers are generally regular; the
form of the corolla varies widely. Thus in borage it is rotate,
tubular in comfrey, funnel-shaped in hounds-tongue, and salver-shaped
in alkanet (<i>Anchusa</i>); the throat is often closed by
scale-like outgrowths from the corolla, forming the so-called
corona. A departure from the usual regular corolla occurs in
<i>Echium</i> and a few allied genera, where it is oblique; in <i>Lycopsis</i>
it is also bent.</p>

<p class="pt2">The five stamens alternate in position with the lobes of the
corolla. The ovary, of two carpels, is seated on a ring-like disk
which secretes honey. Each carpel becomes divided by a
median constriction in four portions, each containing one
ovule; the style springs from the centre of the group of four
divisions.</p>

<p>The flowers show well-marked adaptation to insect-visits.
Their colour and tendency to arrangement on one surface, with
the presence of honey, serve to
attract insects. The scales around
the throat of the corolla protect
the pollen and honey from wet or
undesirable visitors, and by their
difference in colour from the corolla-lobes,
as in the yellow eye of
forget-me-not, may serve to indicate
the position of the honey. In most
genera the fruit consists of one-seeded
nutlets, generally four, but
one or more may be undeveloped.
The shape of the nutlet and the
character of its coat are very varied.
Thus in <i>Lithospermum</i> the nutlets
are hard like a stone, in <i>Myosotis</i>
usually polished, in <i>Cynoglossum</i>
covered with bristles, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The order is widely spread in
temperate and tropical regions, and
contains 85 genera with about 1200 species. Its chief centre
is the Mediterranean region, whence it extends over central
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span>
Europe and Asia, becoming less frequent northwards. A smaller
centre occurs on the Pacific side of North America. The order
is less developed in the south temperate zone.</p>

<p>The order is of little economic value. Several genera, such as
borage and <i>Pulmonaria</i>, were formerly used in medicine, and
the roots yield purple or brown dyes, as in <i>Alkanna tinctoria</i>
(alkanet). Heliotrope or cherry-pie (<i>Heliotropium peruvianum</i>)
is a well-known garden plant.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BORAX<a name="ar163" id="ar163"></a></span> (sodium pyroborate or sodium biborate), Na<span class="su">2</span>B<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">7</span>,
a substance which appears in commerce under two forms,
namely &ldquo;common&rdquo; or prismatic borax, Na<span class="su">2</span>B<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">7</span>·10H<span class="su">2</span>O, and
&ldquo;jewellers&rsquo;&rdquo; or octahedral borax, Na<span class="su">2</span>B<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">7</span>·5H<span class="su">2</span>O. It is to be
noted that the term &ldquo;borax&rdquo; was used by the alchemists in a
very vague manner, and is therefore not to be taken as meaning
the substance now specifically known by the name. Prismatic
borax is found widely distributed as a natural product (see below,
<i>Mineralogy</i>) in Tibet, and in Canada, Peru and Transylvania,
while the bed of Borax Lake, near Clear Lake in California,
is occupied by a large mass of crystallized borax, which is fit
for use by the assayer without undergoing any preliminary
purification. The supply of borax is, however, mainly derived
from the boric acid of Tuscany, which is fused in a reverberatory
furnace with half its weight of sodium carbonate, and the mass
after cooling is extracted with warm water. An alternative
method is to dissolve sodium carbonate in lead-lined steam-heated
pans, and add the boric acid gradually; the solution
then being concentrated until the borax crystallizes. Borax
is also prepared from the naturally occurring calcium borate,
which is mixed in a finely divided condition with the requisite
quantity of soda ash; the mixture is fused, extracted with water
and concentrated until the solution commences to crystallize.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>From a supersaturated aqueous solution of borax, the pentahydrate,
Na<span class="su">2</span>B<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">7</span>·5H<span class="su">2</span>O, is deposited when evaporation takes place
at somewhat high temperatures. The same hydrate can be prepared
by dissolving borax in water until the solution has a specific gravity
of 1.246 and then allowing the solution to cool. The pentahydrate
is deposited between 79° C. and 56° C.; below this temperature the
decahydrate or ordinary borax, Na<span class="su">2</span>B<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">7</span>·10H<span class="su">2</span>O, is deposited. Crystals
of ordinary borax swell up to a very great extent on heating, losing
their water of crystallization and melting to a clear white glass.
The crystals of octahedral borax fuse more easily than those of the
prismatic form and are less liable to split when heated, so that they
are preferable for soldering or fluxing. Fused borax dissolves many
metallic oxides, forming complex borates which in many cases show
characteristic colours. Its use in soldering depends on the fact that
solder only adheres to the surface of an untarnished metal, and consequently
a little borax is placed on the surface of the metal and heated
by the soldering iron in order to remove any superficial film of oxide.
It is also used for glazing pottery, in glass-making and the glazing
of linen.</p>

<p>Boric acid (<i>q.v.</i>) being only a weak acid, its salts readily undergo
hydrolytic dissociation in aqueous solution, and this property can
be readily shown with a concentrated aqueous solution of borax,
for by adding litmus and then just sufficient acetic acid to turn the
litmus red, the addition of a large volume of water to the solution
changes the colour back to blue again. The boric acid being scarcely
ionized gives only a very small quantity of hydrogen ions, whilst
the base (sodium hydroxide) produced by the hydrolysis occasioned
by the dilution of the solution, being a &ldquo;strong base,&rdquo; is highly
ionized and gives a comparatively large amount of hydroxyl ions.
In the solution, therefore, there is now an excess of hydroxyl ions;
consequently it has an alkaline reaction and the litmus turns blue.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Mineralogy.</i>&mdash;The Tibetan mineral deposits have been known
since very early times, and formerly the crude material was
exported to Europe, under the name of <i>tincal</i>, for the preparation
of pure borax and other boron salts. The most westerly of the
Tibetan deposits are in the lake-plain of Pugha on the Rulangchu,
a tributary of the Indus, at an elevation of 15,000 ft.: here the
impure borax (<i>sohaga</i>) occurs over an area of about 2 sq. m.,
and is covered by a saline efflorescence; successive crops
are obtained by the action of rain and snow and subsequent
evaporation. Deposits of purer material (<i>chú tsalé</i> or water
borax) occur at the lakes of Rudok, situated to the east of the
Pugha district; also still farther to the east at the great lakes
Tengri Nor, north of Lhasa, and several other places. More
recently, the extensive deposits of borates (chiefly, however,
of calcium; see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Colemanite</a></span>) in the Mohave desert on the
borders of California and Nevada, and in the Atacama desert
in South America, have been the chief commercial sources of
boron compounds. The boron contained in solution in the
salt lakes has very probably been supplied by hot springs and
solfataras of volcanic origin, such as those which at the present
day charge the waters of the lagoons in Tuscany with boric acid.
The deposits formed by evaporation from these lakes and marshes
or salines, are mixtures of borates, various alkaline salts (sodium
carbonate, sulphate, chloride), gypsum, &amp;c. In the mud of the
lakes and in the surrounding marshy soil fine isolated crystals
of borax are frequently found. For example, crystals up to 7 in.
in length and weighing a pound each have been found in large
numbers at Borax Lake in Lake county, and at Borax Lake in
San Bernardino county, both in California.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Borax crystallizes with ten molecules of water, the composition
of the crystals being Na<span class="su">2</span>B<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">7</span> + 10H<span class="su">2</span>O. The crystals belong to the
monoclinic system, and it is a curious fact that in habit and angles
they closely resemble pyroxene (a silicate of calcium, magnesium
and iron). There is a perfect cleavage parallel to the orthopinacoid
and less perfect cleavages parallel to the faces of the prism. The
mineral is transparent to opaque and white, sometimes greyish,
bluish or greenish in colour. Hardness 2-2½; sp. gr. 1.69-1.72.</p>

<p>The optical characters are interesting, because of the striking
crossed dispersion of the optic axes, of which phenomenon borax
affords the best example. The optic figure seen in convergent
polarized light through a section cut parallel to the plane of symmetry
of a borax crystal is symmetrical only with respect to the
central point. The plane of the optic axes for red light is inclined
at 2° to that for blue light, and the angle between the optic axes
themselves is 3° greater for red than for blue light.</p>

He studied at La Flèche, and at an early age obtained a commission
in the cavalry. In 1756 he presented a <i>Mémoire sur le
mouvement des projectiles</i> to the Academy of Sciences, who elected
him a member. He was present at the battle of Hastembeck,
and soon afterwards joined the naval service. He visited the
Azores and the Canary Islands, of which he constructed an
admirable map. In 1782 his frigate was taken by a British
squadron; he himself was carried to England, but was almost
immediately released on parole and returned to France. He
died at Paris on the 20th of February 1799. Borda contributed
a long series of valuable memoirs to the Academy of Sciences.
His researches in hydrodynamics were highly useful for marine
engineering, while the reflecting and repeating circles, as improved
by him, were of great service in nautical astronomy.
He was associated with J.B.J. Delambre and P.F.A. Méchain
in the attempt to determine an arc of the meridian, and the
greater number of the instruments employed in the task were
invented by him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BORDEAUX,<a name="ar166" id="ar166"></a></span> a city of south-western France, capital of the
department of Gironde, 359 m. S.S.W. of Paris by a main line
of the Orléans railway and 159 m. N.W. of Toulouse on the main
line of the Southern railway. Pop. (1906) 237,707. Bordeaux,
one of the finest and most extensive cities in France, is situated
on the left or west bank of the Garonne about 60 m. from the
sea, in a plain which comprises the wine-growing district of Médoc.
The Garonne at this point describes a semicircle, separating the
city proper on the left bank from the important suburb of La
Bastide on the right bank. The river is crossed by the Pont
de Bordeaux, a fine stone structure of the early 19th century,
measuring 1534 ft. in length, and by a railway bridge connecting
the station of the Orléans railway company in La Bastide
with that of the Southern company on the left bank. Looking
west from the Pont de Bordeaux, the view embraces a crescent
of wide and busy quays with a background of lofty warehouses,
factories and mansions, behind which rise towers and steeples.
Almost at the centre of the line of quays is the Place des Quinconces,
round which lie the narrow, winding streets in which the
life of the city is concentrated. Outside this quarter, which contains
most of the important buildings, the streets are narrow and
quiet and bordered by the low white houses which at Bordeaux
take the place of the high tenements characteristic of other large
French towns. The whole city is surrounded by a semicircle
of boulevards, beyond which lie the suburbs of Le Bouscat,
Caudéran, Mérignac, Talence and Bégles. The principal promenades
are situated close together near the centre of the city.
They comprise the beautiful public garden, the allées de Tourny
and the Place des Quinconces. The latter is planted with plane
trees, among which stand two huge statues of Montaigne and
Montesquieu, and terminates upon the quays with two rostral
columns which serve as lighthouses. On its west side there is
a monument to the Girondin deputies proscribed under the
convention in 1793. At its south-west corner the Place des
Quinconces opens into the Place de la Comédie, which contains
the Grand Théâtre (18th century), the masterpiece of the architect
Victor Louis. The Place de la Comédie, the centre of business
in Bordeaux, is traversed by a street which, under the names of
Cours du Chapeau-Rouge, rue de l&rsquo;Intendance and rue Judaïque,
runs from the Place de la Bourse and the quai de la Douane on the
east to the outer boulevards on the west. Another important
thoroughfare, the rue Sainte Cathérine, runs at right angles to
the rue de l&rsquo;Intendance and enters the Place de la Comédie
on the south. The Pont de Bordeaux is continued by the
Cours Victor Hugo, a curved street crossing the rue Sainte
Cathérine and leading to the cathedral of St André. This church,
dating from the 11th to the 14th centuries, is a building in the
Gothic style with certain Romanesque features, chief among
which are the arches in the nave. It consists of a large nave
without aisles, a transept at the extremities of which are the
main entrances, and a choir, flanked by double aisles and chapels
and containing many works of art. Both the north and south
façades are richly decorated with sculpture and statuary. Of
the four towers flanking the principal portals, only those to the
north are surmounted by spires. Near the choir stands an
isolated tower. It contains the great bell of the cathedral and
is known as the Clocher Pey-Berland, after the archbishop of
Bordeaux who erected it in the 15th century. Of the numerous
other churches of Bordeaux the most notable are St Seurin (11th
to the 15th centuries), with a finely sculptured southern portal;
Ste Croix (12th and 13th centuries), remarkable for its Romanesque
façade; and St Michel, a fine Gothic building of the 15th
and 16th centuries. The bell tower of St Michel, which has the
highest spire (354 ft.) in the south of France, dates from the
end of the 15th century, and, like that of the cathedral, stands
apart from its church. The palace of the Faculties of Science
and of Letters (1881-1886) contains the tomb of Michel de
Montaigne. The prefecture, the hôtel de ville, the bourse and the
custom-house belong to the 15th century. The law-courts and
the hospital of St André (the foundation of which dates from
1390) belong to the first half of the 19th century. Of greater
antiquarian interest is the Palais Gallien, situated near the
public garden, consisting of remains of lofty arcades, vaulting
and fragments of wall, which once formed part of a Roman
amphitheatre. Bordeaux lost its fortifications in the 18th century,
but four of the old gateways or triumphal arches belonging
to that period still remain. Still older are the Porte de Cailhau,
once the entrance to the Palais de l&rsquo;Ombrière, which before its
destruction was the residence of the duke of Aquitaine, and the
Porte de l&rsquo;Hôtel de Ville, the former of the 15th, the latter of the
13th and 16th centuries.</p>

<p>Bordeaux is the seat of an archbishop, the headquarters of
the XVIII. army corps, the centre of an <i>académie</i> (educational
division) and the seat of a court of appeal. A court of assizes
is held there, and there are tribunals of first instance and of
commerce, a council of trade-arbitrators, a chamber of commerce
and a branch of the Bank of France. Its educational institutions
include faculties of law, of science, of letters and of medicine
and pharmacy, a faculty of Catholic theology, lycées, training
colleges, a higher school of commerce, a chair of agriculture, a
school of fine art and a naval school of medicine. There are
several museums, including one with a large collection of pictures
and sculptures, a library with over 200,000 volumes and numerous
learned societies.</p>

<p>The trade of Bordeaux, the fourth port in France, is chiefly
carried on by sea. Its port, 5½ m. long and on the average 550
yds. wide, is formed by the basin of the Garonne and is divided
into two portions by the Pont de Bordeaux. That to the south
is used only by small craft; that to the north is accessible to
vessels drawing from 21 to 26 ft. according to the state of the
tide. From 1000 to 1200 vessels can be accommodated in the
harbour, which is lined on both sides by quays and sloping
wharves served by railway lines. At the northen extremity
of the harbour, on the left bank, there is a floating basin of 25
acres in extent, capable of receiving the largest vessels; it has
over 1900 yds. of quays and is furnished with a repairing dock
and with elaborate machinery for the loading and unloading of
goods. In 1907 the construction of new docks behind this basin
was begun. The city maintains commercial relations with nearly
all countries, but chiefly with Great Britain, Spain, Argentina,
Portugal and the United States. The most important line of
steamers using the port is the South American service of the
Messageries Maritimes. The total value of the exports and
imports of Bordeaux averages between 25 and 26 millions sterling
yearly. Of this amount exports make up 13½ millions, of which
the sales of wine bring in about one quarter. The city is the
centre of the trade in &ldquo;Bordeaux&rdquo; wines, and the wine-cellars
of the quays are one of its principal sights. Other principal
exports are brandy, hides and skins, sugar, rice, woollen and
cotton goods, salt-fish, chemicals, oil-cake, pitwood, fruit,
potatoes and other vegetables. The chief imports are wool,
fish, timber, rice, wine, rubber, coal, oil-grains, hardware,
agricultural and other machinery and chemicals. A large fleet
is annually despatched to the cod-fisheries of Newfoundland and
Iceland. The most important industry is ship-building and refitting.
Ironclads and torpedo-boats as well as merchant vessels
are constructed. Railway carriages are also built. The industries
subsidiary to the wine-trade, such as wine-mixing, cooperage and
the making of bottles, corks, capsules, straw envelopes and
wooden cases, occupy many hands. There are also flour-mills,
sugar-refineries, breweries, distilleries, oil-works, cod-drying
works, manufactories of canned and preserved fruits, vegetables
and meat, and of chocolate. Chemicals, leather, iron-ware,
machinery and pottery are manufactured, and a tobacco factory
employs 1500 hands.</p>

<p>Bordeaux (<i>Burdigala</i>) was originally the chief town of the
Bituriges Vivisci. Under the Roman empire it became a
flourishing commercial city, and in the 4th century it was made
the capital of Aquitania Secunda. Ausonius, a writer of the 4th
century, who was a native of the place, describes it as four-square
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
and surrounded with walls and lofty towers, and celebrates its
importance as one of the greatest educational centres of Gaul.
In the evils that resulted from the disintegration of the empire
Bordeaux had its full share, and did not recover its prosperity
till the beginning of the 10th century. Along with Guienne it
belonged to the English kings for nearly three hundred years
(1154-1453), and was for a time the seat of the brilliant court of
Edward the Black Prince, whose son Richard was born in the
city. An extensive commerce was gradually developed between
the Bordeaux merchants and their fellow-subjects in England,&mdash;London,
Hull, Exeter, Dartmouth, Bristol and Chester being the
principal ports with which they traded. The English administration
was favourable to the liberties as well as to the trade of the
city. In 1235 it received the right of electing its mayors, who
were assisted in the administration by a &ldquo;jurade&rdquo; or municipal
council. The influence of Bordeaux was still further increased
when several important towns of the region, among them St
Emilion and Libourne, united in a federation under its leadership.
The defeat of the English at the battle of Castillon in 1453 was
followed, after a siege of three months, by the submission of
Bordeaux to Charles VII. The privileges of the city were at once
curtailed, and were only partially restored under Louis XI., who
established there the parlement of Guienne. In 1548 the inhabitants
resisted the imposition of the salt-tax by force of arms,
a rebellion for which they were punished by the constable Anne
de Montmorency with merciless severity.</p>

<p>The reformed religion found numerous adherents at Bordeaux,
and after the massacre of St Bartholomew nearly three hundred
of its inhabitants lost their lives. The 17th century was a period
of disturbance. The city was for a time the chief support of the
Fronde, and on two occasions, in 1653 and 1675, troops were sent
to repress insurrections against royal measures. In the middle
of the 18th century, a period of commercial and architectural
activity for Bordeaux, the marquis de Tourny, <i>intendant</i> of
Guienne, did much to improve the city by widening the streets
and laying out public squares. It was the headquarters of the
Girondists at the Revolution, and during the Reign of Terror
suffered almost as severely as Lyons and Marseilles. Its commerce
was greatly reduced under Napoleon I. In 1814 it declared
for the house of Bourbon; and Louis XVIII. afterwards gave

as the comte de Chambord. In 1870 the French government was
transferred to Bordeaux from Tours on the approach of the
Germans to the latter city.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BORDENTOWN,<a name="ar169" id="ar169"></a></span> a city of Burlington county, New Jersey,
U.S.A., on the E. bank of the Delaware river, 6 m. S. of Trenton
and 28 m. N.E. of Philadelphia. Pop. (1890) 4232; (1900)
4110; (1905) 4073; (1910) 4250. It is served by the Pennsylvania
railway, the Camden &amp; Trenton railway (an electric line,
forming part of the line between Philadelphia and New York)
and by freight and passenger steamboat lines on the Delaware.
Bordentown is attractively situated on a broad, level plain, 65 ft.
above the river, with wide, beautifully shaded streets. The city
is the seat of the Bordentown Military Institute (with the Woodward
memorial library), of the state manual training and
industrial school for coloured youth, of the St Joseph&rsquo;s convent
and mother-house of the Sisters of Mercy, and of St Joseph&rsquo;s
academy for girls. There are ship-yards, iron foundries and
forges, machine shops, shirt factories, a pottery for the manufacture
of sanitary earthenware, a woollen mill and canning
factories. The first settlers on the site of the city were several
Quaker families who came in the 18th century. Bordentown
was laid out by Joseph Borden, in whose honour it was named;
was incorporated as a borough in 1825; was re-incorporated in
1849, and was chartered as a city in 1867. It was the home for
some years of Francis Hopkinson and of his son Joseph Hopkinson
(whose residences are still standing), and from 1817 to 1832
and in 1837-1839 was the home of Joseph Bonaparte, ex-king
of Spain, who lived on a handsome estate known as &ldquo;Bonaparte&rsquo;s
Park,&rdquo; which he laid out with considerable magnificence. Here
he entertained many distinguished visitors, including Lafayette.
The legislature of New Jersey passed a special law, enabling him,
as an alien, to own real property, and it is said to have been in
reference to this that the state received its nickname &ldquo;Spain.&rdquo;
Prince Napoleon Lucien Charles Murat, the second son of
Joachim Murat, also lived here for many years; and the estate
known as &ldquo;Ironsides&rdquo; was long the home of Rear-Admiral
Charles Stewart. The Camden &amp; Amboy railway, begun in 1831
and completed from Bordentown to South Amboy (34 m.) in
1832, was one of the first railways in the United States; in
September 1831 the famous engine &ldquo;Johnny Bull,&rdquo; built in
England and imported for this railway, had its first trial at
Bordentown, and a monument now marks the site where the first
rails were laid.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BORDERS, THE,<a name="ar170" id="ar170"></a></span> a name applied to the territory on both sides
of the boundary line between England and Scotland. The term
has also a literary and historical as well as a geographical sense,
and is most frequently employed of the Scottish side. The line
begins on the coast of Berwickshire at a spot 3 m. N. by W. of
Berwick, and, after running a short distance W. and S., reaches
the Tweed near the village of Paxton, whence it keeps to the
river to a point just beyond Carham. There it strikes off S.S.E.
to the Cheviot Hills, the watershed of which for 35 m. constitutes
the boundary, which is thereafter formed by a series of streams&mdash;Bells
Burn, the Kershope, Liddel and Esk. After following the
last named for 1 m. it cuts across country due west to the Sark,
which it follows to the river&rsquo;s mouth at the head of the Solway
Firth. The length of the boundary thus described is 108 m.,
but in a direct line from the Solway to the North Sea the distance
is only 70 m. At the extreme east end a small district of 8 sq. m.,
consisting of the tract north of the Tweed which is not included
in Scotland, forms the &ldquo;bounds&rdquo; or &ldquo;liberties&rdquo; of Berwick, or
the country of the borough and town of Berwick-on-Tweed. At
the extreme west between the Sark and Esk as far up the latter
as its junction with the Liddel, there was a strip of country, a
&ldquo;No man&rsquo;s land,&rdquo; for generations the haunt of outlaws and
brigands. This was called the Debatable Land, because the
possession of it was a constant source of contention between
England and Scotland until its boundaries were finally adjusted
in 1552. The English Border counties are Northumberland and
Cumberland, the Scottish Berwick, Roxburgh and Dumfries;
though historically, and still by usage, the Scottish shires of
Selkirk and Peebles have always been classed as Border shires.
On the English side the region is watered by the Till, Bowmont,
Coquet, Rede and North Tyne; on the Scottish by the Tweed,
Whiteadder, Leet, Kale, Jed, Kershope, Liddel, Esk and Sark.
Physically there is a marked difference between the country on
each side. On the southern it mostly consists of lofty, bleak
moorland, affording subsistence for sheep and cattle, and rugged
glens and ravines, while on the northern there are many stretches
of fertile soil, especially in the valleys and dales, and the landscape
is often romantic and beautiful. Railway communication is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span>
supplied by the east coast route to Berwick, the Waverley route
through Liddesdale, the London &amp; North-Western by Carlisle,
the North British branch from Berwick to St Boswells, and
the North Eastern lines from Berwick to Kelso, Alnwick to
Coldstream, and Newcastle to Carlisle.</p>

<p>At frequent intervals during a period of 1500 years the region
was the scene of strife and lawlessness. The Roman road of
Watling Street crossed the Cheviots at Brownhartlaw (1664 ft.),
close to the camp of <i>Ad Fines</i>, by means of which the warlike
Brigantes on the south and the Gadeni and Otadeni on the north
were held in check, while another Roman road, the Wheel
Causeway, passed into Scotland near the headwaters of the
North Tyne and Liddel. (For early history see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lothian</a></span>;
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Northumbria</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Strathclyde</a></span>.) In the 12th century were
founded the abbeys of Hexham and Alnwick, the priory church
of Lindisfarne and the cathedral of Carlisle on the English side,
and on the Scottish the abbeys of Jedburgh, Kelso, Melrose and
Dryburgh. The deaths of Alexander III. (1286) and Margaret
the Maid of Norway (1290), whose right to the throne had been
acknowledged, plunged the country into the wars of the succession
and independence, and until the union of the crowns
in 1603 the borders were frequently disturbed. Berwick and
Carlisle were repeatedly assailed, and battles took place at
Halidon Hill (1333), Otterburn (1388), Nisbet (1402), Homildon
(1402), Piperden (1435), Hedgeley Moor (1464), Flodden (1513),
Solway Moss (1542), and Ancrum Moor (1544), in addition to
many fights arising out of family feuds and raids fomented by
the Armstrongs, Eliots, Grahams, Johnstones, Maxwells and
other families, of which the most serious were the encounters at
Arkenholme (Langholm) in 1455, the Raid of Reidswire (1575),
and the bloody combat at Dryfe Sands (1593). The English
expeditions of 1544 and 1545 were exceptionally disastrous, since
they involved the destruction of the four Scottish border abbeys,
the sack of many towns, and the obliteration of Roxburgh.
The only other important conflict belongs to the Covenanters&rsquo;
time, when the marquess of Montrose was defeated at Philiphaugh
in 1645. Partly for the defence of the kingdoms and
partly to overawe the freebooters and mosstroopers who were
a perpetual menace to the peace until they were suppressed in
the 17th century, castles were erected at various points on both
sides of the border.</p>

<p>Even during the period when relations between England and
Scotland were strained, the sovereigns of both countries recognized
it to be their duty to protect property and regulate the
lawlessness of the borders. The frontier was divided into the
East, Middle and West Marches, each under the control of an
English and a Scots warden. The posts were generally filled by
eminent and capable men who had to keep the peace, enforce
punishment for breach of the law, and take care that neither
country encroached on the boundary of the other. The wardens
usually conferred once a year on matters of common interest,
and as a rule their meetings were conducted in a friendly spirit,
though in 1575 a display of temper led to the affair of the Raid
of Reidswire. The appointment was not only one of the most
important in this quarter of the kingdom, but lucrative as well,
part of the fines and forfeits falling to the warden, who was also
entitled to ration and forage for his retinue. On the occasion of
his first public progress to London, James I. of England attended
service in Berwick church (March 27, 1603) &ldquo;to return thanks
for his peaceful entry into his new dominions.&rdquo; Anxious to
blot out all memory of the bitter past, he forbade the use of
the word &ldquo;Borders,&rdquo; hoping that the designation &ldquo;Middle
Shires&rdquo; might take its place. Frontier fortresses were also to
be dismantled and their garrisons reduced to nominal strength.
In course of time this policy had the desired effect, though the
expression &ldquo;Borders&rdquo; proved too convenient geographically
to be dropped, the king&rsquo;s proposed amendment being in point
of fact merely sentimental and, in the relative positions then and
now of England and Scotland, meaningless. Some English
strongholds, such as Alnwick, Chillingham, Ford and Naworth,
have been modernized; others, like Norham, Wark and Warkworth,
are picturesque ruins; but most of the Scottish fortresses
have been demolished and their sites built over, or are now
represented by grass-grown mounds. Another familiar feature
in the landscape is the chain of peel towers crossing the country
from coast to coast. Many were homes of marauding chiefs, and
nearly all were used as beacon-stations to give alarm of foray or
invasion. Early in the 18th century the Scottish gipsies found a
congenial home on the Roxburghshire side of the Cheviots; and
at a later period the Scottish border became notorious for a
hundred years as offering hospitality to runaway couples who
were clandestinely married at Gretna Green, Coldstream or
Lamberton. The toll-house of Lamberton displayed the following
intimation&mdash;&ldquo;Ginger-beer sold here and marriages performed
on the most reasonable terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Border ballads occupy a distinctive place in English literature.
Many of them were rescued from oblivion by Sir Walter Scott,
who ransacked the district for materials for his <i>Minstrelsy of
the Scottish Border</i>, which appeared in 1802 and 1803. Border
traditions and folklore, and the picturesque, pathetic and stirring
incidents of which the country was so often the scene, appealed
strongly to James Hogg (&ldquo;the Ettrick Shepherd&rdquo;), John
Wilson (&ldquo;Christopher North&rdquo;), and John Mackay Wilson (1804-1835),
whose <i>Tales of the Borders</i>, published in 1835, long enjoyed
popular favour.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BORDONE, PARIS<a name="ar172" id="ar172"></a></span> (1495-1570), Venetian painter, was born
at Treviso, and entered the <i>bottega</i> of Titian in 1509. Vasari,
to whom we are indebted for nearly all the facts of Bordone&rsquo;s
life&mdash;later research has not added much to our knowledge&mdash;holds
that he did not spend many years with Titian and set
himself to imitate the manner of Giorgione to the utmost of his
power. As a matter of fact, the Giorgionesque traits in Bordone&rsquo;s
earlier works are derived entirely from Titian, whom he imitated
so closely that to this day some of his paintings pass under
Titian&rsquo;s name. Crowe and Cavalcaselle and Dr Bode ascribe
to Bordone the &ldquo;Baptism of Christ&rdquo; in the Capitoline gallery,
but Morelli sees in it an early work of Titian. Paris Bordone
subsequently executed many important mural paintings in
Venice, Treviso and Vicenza, all of which have perished. In
1538 he was invited to France by Francis I., at whose court he
painted many portraits, though no trace of them is to be found
in French collections, the two portraits at the Louvre being later
acquisitions. On his return journey he undertook works of
great importance for the Fugger palace at Augsburg, which
again have been lost sight of. Bordone&rsquo;s pictures are of very
unequal merit. They have a certain nobility of style, and that
golden harmony of colour which he derived from Titian, together
with the realistic conception of the human figure and the dignified
character of his portraiture. On the other hand, his nudes are a
little coarse in form, and the action of his figures is frequently
unnatural and affected. A true child of the Renaissance, he
also painted a number of religious pictures, numerous mythological
scenes, allegories, nymphs, cupids and subjects from
Ovid&rsquo;s fables, but he excelled as a portraitist. His principal
surviving work is the &ldquo;Fisherman and Doge&rdquo; at the Venice
Academy. The National Gallery, London, has a &ldquo;Daphnis and
Chloe&rdquo; and a portrait of a lady, whilst a &ldquo;Holy Family&rdquo; from
his brush is at Bridgwater House. Other important works of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span>
his are the &ldquo;Madonna&rdquo; in the Tadini collection at Lovere,
the paintings in the Duomo of Treviso, two mythological pictures
at the Villa Borghese and the Doria palace in Rome, the &ldquo;Chess
Players&rdquo; in Berlin, a very little-known portrait of superb
quality in the possession of the landgrave of Hesse at Kronberg,
and a &ldquo;Baptism of Christ&rdquo; in Philadelphia. Besides these,
there are examples of his art in Bergamo, Milan, Genoa, Padua,
Siena, Venice, Florence, Munich, Dresden and Vienna.</p>

<p>Beyond some references in general works on Italian painting,
very little has been written on Paris Bordone since the days of

e delle Opere di Paris Bordone</i>; and the <i>Nuova Antologia</i> (November

<p><span class="bold">BORE,<a name="ar173" id="ar173"></a></span> a high tidal wave rushing up a narrow estuary or
tidal river. The bore of the Severn is produced by a tide that
rises 18 ft. in an hour and a half. This body of water becomes
compressed in the narrowing funnel-shaped estuary, and heaped
up into an advancing wave extending from bank to bank. The
phenomenon is also particularly well illustrated in the Bay of
Fundy. The origin of this word is doubtful, but it is usually
referred to a Scandinavian word <i>b&#257;ra</i>, a wave, billow. The other
name by which the phenomenon is known, &ldquo;eagre,&rdquo; is also of
unknown origin. There is, of course, no connexion with &ldquo;bore,&rdquo;
to make a hole by piercing or drilling, which is a common Teutonic
word, cf. Ger. <i>bohren</i>, the Indo-European root being seen in Lat.
<i>forare</i>, to pierce, Gr. <span class="grk" title="pharos">&#966;&#940;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, plough. For the making of deep
holes for shafts, wells, &amp;c., see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Boring</a></span>. The substantival use of
this word is generally confined to the circular cavity of objects
of tubular shape, particularly of a gun, hence the internal
diameter of a gun, its &ldquo;calibre&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gun</a></span>). A &ldquo;bore&rdquo; is also
a tiresome, wearying person, particularly one who persistently
harps on one subject, in or out of season, whatever interest his
audience may take in it. This has generally been taken to be
merely a metaphorical use of &ldquo;bore,&rdquo; to pierce. The earliest
sense, however, in which it is found in English (1766, in certain
letters printed in Jesse&rsquo;s <i>Life of George Selwyn</i>) is that of <i>ennui</i>,
and a French origin is suggested. The <i>New English Dictionary</i>
conjectures a possible source in Fr. <i>bourrer</i>, to stuff, satiate.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BOREAS,<a name="ar174" id="ar174"></a></span> in Greek mythology, a personification of the north
wind. He was described as the son of Astraeus and Eos,
brother of Hesperus, Notus and Zephyrus. His dwelling-place
was on Mount Haemus in Thrace, or at Salmydessus, near the
country of the Hyperboreans. He was said to have carried off
the beautiful Oreithyia, a daughter of Erechtheus, king of Athens,
when he found her leading the dance at a festival, or gathering
flowers on the banks of the Ilissus or some other spot in the
neighbourhood of Athens. He had before wooed her in vain,
and now carried her off to Mount Haemus, where they lived as
king and queen of the winds, and had two sons, Zetes and Calaïs,
and two daughters, Cleopatra and Chione (Apollodorus iii. 15;
Ovid, <i>Metam.</i> vi. 677). For the loss of Oreithyia the Athenians
in after times counted on Boreas&rsquo;s friendliness, and were assured
of it when he sent storms which wrecked the Persian fleet at
Athos and at Sepias (Herodotus vii. 189). For this they erected
to him a sanctuary or altar near the Ilissus, and held a festival
(Boreasmos) in his honour. Thurii also, which was a colony
of Athens, offered sacrifice to him as Euergetes every year,
because he had destroyed the hostile fleet of Dionysius the elder
(Aelian, <i>Var. Hist.</i> xii. 61). In works of art Boreas was represented
as bearded, powerful, draped against cold, and winged.
On the Tower of the Winds at Athens he is figured holding a
shell, such as is blown by Tritons. Boreas carrying off Oreithyia
is the subject of a beautiful bronze relief in the British Museum,
found in the island of Calymna. The same subject occurs
frequently on painted Greek vases.</p>

by taking part in the resistance offered by the Lyonnese
royalists against the Convention, and Petrus Borel was educated
in Paris to be an architect. He soon abandoned his profession

various volumes: <i>Rhapsodies</i> (1832), poems; <i>Champavert,

<p><span class="bold">BORELLI, GIOVANNI ALFONSO<a name="ar176" id="ar176"></a></span> (1608-1679), Italian
physiologist and physicist, was born at Naples on the 28th of
January 1608. He was appointed professor of mathematics
at Messina in 1649 and at Pisa in 1656. In 1667 he returned to
Messina, but in 1674 was obliged to retire to Rome, where he lived
under the protection of Christina, queen of Sweden, and died on
the 31st of December 1679. His best-known work is <i>De motu
animalium</i> (Rome, 1680-1681), in which he sought to explain the
movements of the animal body on mechanical principles; he
thus ranks as the founder of the iatrophysical school. In a letter,
<i>Del movimento della cometa apparsa il mese di decembre 1664</i>,
published in 1665 under the pseudonym Pier Maria Mutoli,
he was the first to suggest the idea of a parabolic path; and
another of his astronomical works was <i>Theorica mediceorum
planetarum ex causis physicis deducta</i> (Florence, 1666), in which he
considered the influence of attraction on the satellites of Jupiter.
He also wrote: <i>Della Causa delle Febbri maligni</i> (Pisa, 1658);
<i>De Renum usu Judicium</i> (Strassburg, 1664); <i>Euclides Restitutus</i>

Borgå into the Gulf of Finland, about 33 m. by rail N.W. of
Helsingfors. Pop. (1810) 1693; (1870) 3478; (1904) 5255.
It is the seat of a Lutheran bishopric which extends over the
provinces of Viborg and St Michel with portions of Tavastehus
and Nyland; it possesses a beautiful cathedral, and a high school
(where the well-known Finnish poet Runeberg lectured for many
years), and is the seat of a court of appeal. The weaving of
sail-cloth and the manufacture of tobacco are the principal
industries, and the chief articles of trade are wood, butter and
furs. Borgå was once a city of great dignity and importance,
but the rapid growth of Helsingfors has somewhat eclipsed it.
In 1809, when the estates of Finland were summoned to a special
diet to decide the future of the country, Borgå was the place of
meeting, and it was in the cathedral that the emperor Alexander
I. pledged himself as grand duke of Finland to maintain the
constitution and liberties of the grand duchy.</p>

created his nephew prince of Vivero on the 17th of November

<p><span class="bold">BORGHESI, BARTOLOMMEO<a name="ar179" id="ar179"></a></span> (1781-1860), Italian antiquarian,
was born at Savignano, near Rimini, on the 11th of
July 1781. He studied at Bologna and Rome. Having weakened
his eyesight by the study of documents of the middle ages, he
turned his attention to epigraphy and numismatics. At Rome
he arranged and catalogued several collections of coins, amongst
them those of the Vatican, a task which he undertook for Pius
VII. In consequence of the disturbances of 1821, Borghesi
retired to San Marino, where he died on the 16th of April 1860.
Although mainly an enthusiastic student, he was for some time
podestà of the little republic. His monumental work, <i>Nuovi
Frammenti dei Fasti Consolari Capitolini</i> (1818-1820), attracted
the attention of the learned world as furnishing positive bases
for the chronology of Roman history, while his contributions to
Italian archaeological journals established his reputation as a
numismatist and antiquarian. Before his death, Borghesi conceived
the design of publishing a collection of all the Latin
inscriptions of the Roman world. The work was taken up by
the Academy of Berlin under the auspices of Mommsen, and the
result was the <i>Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum</i>. Napoleon III.

<p><span class="bold">BORGIA, CESARE,<a name="ar180" id="ar180"></a></span> duke of Valentinois and Romagna (1476-1507)
was the son of Pope Alexander VI. by Vanozza dei
Cattanei. He was born at Rome while his father was cardinal,
and on the latter&rsquo;s elevation to the papacy (1492) he was created
archbishop of Valencia, and a year later cardinal. Cesare was
Alexander&rsquo;s favourite son, and it was for him that the pope&rsquo;s
notorious nepotism was most extensively practised. In the early
years of his father&rsquo;s pontificate he led a profligate life at the
Vatican. When Charles VIII. left Rome for the conquest of
Naples (January 25, 1495), Cesare accompanied him as a hostage
for the pope&rsquo;s good behaviour, but he escaped at Velletri and
returned to Rome. He soon began to give proofs of the violence
for which he afterwards became notorious; when in 1497 his
brother Giovanni, duke of Gandia, was murdered, the deed was
attributed, in all probability with reason, to Cesare. It was
suggested that the motive of the murder was the brothers&rsquo;
rivalry in the affection of Donna Sancha, wife of Giuffrè, the
pope&rsquo;s youngest son, while there were yet darker hints at incestuous
relations of Cesare and the duke with their sister
Lucrezia. But it is more probable that Cesare, who contemplated
exchanging his ecclesiastical dignities for a secular career,
regarded his brother&rsquo;s splendid position with envy, and was
determined to enjoy the whole of his father&rsquo;s favours.</p>

<p>In July 1497 Cesare went to Naples as papal legate and
crowned Frederick of Aragon king. Now that the duke of
Gandia was dead, the pope needed Cesare to carry out his political
schemes, and tried to arrange a wealthy marriage for him.
Cesare wished to marry Carlotta, the daughter of the king of
Naples, but both she and her father resolutely refused an alliance
with &ldquo;a priest, the bastard of a priest.&rdquo; In August 1498, Cesare
in the consistory asked for the permission of the cardinals and
the pope to renounce the priesthood, and the latter granted it
&ldquo;for the good of his soul.&rdquo; On the 1st of October he set forth
for France with a magnificent retinue as papal legate to Louis
XII., to bring him the pope&rsquo;s bull annulling his marriage with
Jeanne of France (Louis wished to marry Anne of Brittany).
In exchange he received the duchy of Valentinois, as well as
military assistance for his own enterprises. He found Carlotta
of Naples in France, and having again tried to win her over in
vain, he had to content himself with Charlotte d&rsquo;Albret, sister
of the king of Navarre (May 1499). Alexander now contemplated
sending Cesare to Romagna to subdue the turbulent local despots,
and with the help of the French king carve a principality for
himself out of those territories owing nominal allegiance to the
pope. Cesare made Cesena his headquarters, and with an army
consisting of 300 French lances, 4000 Gascons and Swiss, besides
Italian troops, he attacked Imola, which surrendered at once,
and then besieged Forli, held by Caterina Sforza (<i>q.v.</i>), the
widow of Girolamo Riario. She held out gallantly, but was at
last forced to surrender on the 22nd of January 1500; Cesare
treated her with consideration, and she ended her days in a
convent. The Sforzas having expelled the French from Milan,
Cesare returned to Rome in February, his schemes checked for
the moment; his father rewarded him for his successes by
making him <i>gonfaloniere</i> of the church and conferring many
honours on him; he remained in Rome and took part in bull
fights and other carnival festivities. In July occurred the
murder of the duke of Bisceglie, Lucrezia Borgia&rsquo;s third husband.
He was attacked by assassins on the steps of St Peter&rsquo;s and
badly wounded; attendants carried him to a cardinal&rsquo;s house,
and, fearing poison, he was nursed only by his wife and Sancha,
his sister-in-law. Again Cesare was suspected as the instigator
of the deed, and in fact he almost admitted it himself. Bisceglie
was related to the Neapolitan dynasty, with whose enemies the
pope was allied, and he had had a quarrel with Cesare. When it
appeared that he was recovering from his wounds, Cesare had
him murdered, but not apparently without provocation, for,
according to the Venetian ambassador Cappello, the duke had
tried to murder Cesare first.</p>

<p>In October 1500 Cesare again set out for the Romagna, on the
strength of Venetian friendship, with an army of 10,000 men.
Pandolfo Malatesta of Rimini and Giovanni Sforza of Pesaro
fled, and those cities opened their gates to Cesare. Faenza held
out, for the people were devoted to their lord, Astorre Manfredi,
a handsome and virtuous youth of eighteen. Manfredi surrendered
in April 1501, on the promise that his life should be spared;
but Cesare broke his word, and sent him a prisoner to Rome,
where he was afterwards foully outraged and put to death.
After taking Castel Bolognese he returned to Rome in June, to
take part in the Franco-Spanish intrigues for the partition of
Naples. He was now lord of an extensive territory, and the
pope created him duke of Romagna. His cruelty, his utter want
of scruple, and his good fortune made him a terror to all Italy.
His avidity was insatiable and he could brook no opposition;
but, unlike his father, he was morose, silent and unsympathetic.
His next conquests were Camerino and Urbino, but his power
was now greatly shaken by the conspiracy of La Magione (a
castle near Perugia where the plotters met). Several of the
princes deposed by him, the Orsinis, and some of his own captains,
such as Vitellozzo Vitelli (<i>q.v.</i>), Oliverotto da Fermo, and G.P.
Baglioni, who had been given estates but feared to lose them,
joined forces to conspire against the Borgias. Risings broke out
at Urbino and in Romagna, and the papal troops were defeated;
Cesare could find no allies, and it seemed as though all Italy was
about to turn against the hated family, when the French king
promised help, and this was enough to frighten the confederates
into coming to terms. Most of them had shown very little
political or military skill, and several were ready to betray each
other. But Cesare, while trusting no one, proved a match for
them all. During his operations in northern Romagna, Vitelli,
Oliverotto, Paolo Orsini, and the duke of Gravina, to show their
repentance, seized Senigallia, which still held for the duke of
Urbino, in his name. Cesare arrived at that town, decoyed the
unsuspecting <i>condottieri</i> into his house, had them all arrested, and
two of them, Vitelli and Oliverotto, strangled (December 31, 1502).</p>

<p>He was back in Rome early in 1503, and took part in reducing
the last rebel Orsinis. He was gathering troops for a new expedition
in central Italy in the summer, when both he and his
father were simultaneously seized with fever. The pope died on
the 18th of August, while Cesare was still incapacitated, and this
unfortunate coincidence proved his ruin; it was the one contingency
for which he had not provided. On all sides his enemies
rose up against him; in Romagna the deposed princes prepared
to regain their own, and the Orsinis raised their heads once more
in Rome. Cesare&rsquo;s position was greatly shaken, and when he
tried to browbeat the cardinals by means of Don Michelotto
and his bravos, they refused to be intimidated; he had to leave
Rome in September, trusting that the Spanish cardinals would
elect a candidate friendly to his house. At the conclave Francesco
Todeschini-Piccolomini was elected as Pius III., and he showed
every disposition to be peaceful and respectable, but he was old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>249</span>
and in bad health. Cesare&rsquo;s dominion at once began to fall to
pieces; Guidobaldo, duke of Urbino, returned to his duchy
with Venetian help; and the lords of Piombino, Rimini and
Pesaro soon regained their own; Cesena, defended by a governor
faithful to Cesare, alone held out. Pius III. died on the 18th of
October 1503, and a new conclave was held. Cesare, who could
still count on the Spanish cardinals, wished to prevent the
election of Giuliano della Rovere, the enemy of his house, but the
latter&rsquo;s chances were so greatly improved that it was necessary
to come to terms with him. On the 1st of November he was
elected, and assumed the name of Julius II. He showed no ill-will
towards Cesare, but declared that the latter&rsquo;s territories
must be restored to the church, for &ldquo;we desire the honour of
recovering what our predecessors have wrongfully alienated.&rdquo;
Venice hoped to intervene in Romagna and establish her protectorate
over the principalities, but this Julius was determined
to prevent, and after trying in vain to use Cesare as a means
of keeping out the Venetians, he had him arrested. Borgia&rsquo;s
power was now at an end, and he was obliged to surrender all his
castles in Romagna save Cesena, Forli and Bettinoro, whose
governors refused to accept an order of surrender from a master
who was a prisoner. Finally, it was agreed that if Cesare were
set at liberty he would surrender the castles; this having been
accomplished, he departed for Naples, where the Spaniards were
in possession. The Spanish governor, Gonzalo de Cordova, had
given him a safe-conduct, and he was meditating fresh plans,
when Gonzalo arrested him by the order of Ferdinand of Spain as
a disturber of the peace of Italy (May 1504). In August he was
sent to Spain, where he remained a prisoner for two years; in
November 1506 he made his escape, and fled to the court of his
brother-in-law, the king of Navarre, under whom he took service.
While besieging the castle of Viana, held by the rebellious count
of Lerin, he was killed (March 12, 1507).</p>

<p>Cesare Borgia was a type of the adventurers with which the
Italy of the Renaissance swarmed, but he was cleverer and more
unscrupulous than his rivals. His methods of conquest were
ferocious and treacherous; but once the conquest was made he
governed his subjects with firmness and justice, so that his rule
was preferred to the anarchy of factions and local despots. But
he was certainly not a man of genius, as has long been imagined,
and his success was chiefly due to the support of the papacy;
once his father was dead his career was at an end, and he could no
longer play a prominent part in Italian affairs. His fall proved
on how unsound a basis his system had been built up.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BORGIA, FRANCIS<a name="ar181" id="ar181"></a></span> (1510-1572), Roman Catholic saint,
duke of Gandia, and general of the order of Jesuits, was born at
Gandia (Valencia) on the 10th of October 1510, and from boyhood
was remarkable for his piety. Educated from his twelfth
year at Saragossa under the charge of his uncle the archbishop,
he had begun to show a strong inclination towards the monastic
life, when his father sent him in 1528 to the court of Charles V.
Here he distinguished himself, and on his marriage with Eleanor
de Castro, a Portuguese lady of high rank, he was created
marquis of Lombay, and was appointed master of the horse to
the empress. He accompanied Charles on his African expedition
in 1535, and also into Provence in 1536; and on the death of
the empress in 1539 he was deputed to convoy the body to the
burial-place in Granada. This sad duty confirmed his determination
to leave the court, and also, should he survive his consort,
to embrace the monastic life. On his return to Toledo, however,
new honours were thrust upon him, much against his will; he
was made viceroy of Catalonia and commander of the order of St
James. At Barcelona, the seat of his government, he lived a
life of great austerity, but discharged his official duties with
energy and efficiency until 1543, when, having succeeded his
father in the dukedom, he at length obtained permission to resign
his viceroyalty and to retire to a more congenial mode of life at
Gandia. Having already held some correspondence with Ignatius
Loyola, he now powerfully encouraged the recently founded
order of Jesus. One of his first cares at Gandia was to build
a Jesuit college; and on the death of Eleanor in 1546, he resolved
to become himself a member of the society. The difficulties
arising from political and family circumstances were removed by
a papal dispensation, which allowed him, in the interests of his
young children, to retain his dignities and worldly possessions
for four years after taking the vows. In 1550 he visited Rome,
where he was received with every mark of distinction, and where
he furnished the means for building the Collegium Romanum.
Returning to Spain in the following year, he formally resigned his
rank and estate in favour of his eldest son, assumed the Jesuit
habit, was ordained priest, and entered upon a life of penance and
prayer. At his own earnest request, seconded by Loyola, a
proposal that he should be created a cardinal by Julius III.
was departed from; and at the command of his superior he
employed himself in the work of itinerant preaching. In 1554
he was appointed commissary-general of the order in Spain,
Portugal and the Indies, in which capacity he showed great
activity, and was successful in founding many new and thriving
colleges. In 1556, shortly after Charles V. retired, Borgia had
an interview with him, but would not yield to his inducements
to transfer his allegiance to the older order of Hieronymites.
Some time afterwards Borgia was employed by Charles to conduct
negotiations with reference to a project which was to secure for
Don Carlos of Spain the Portuguese succession in the event of
the death of his cousin Don Sebastian. On the death of Lainez
in 1565, Francis Borgia was chosen to succeed him as third general
of the Jesuits. In this capacity he showed great zeal and administrative
skill; and so great was the progress of the society
under his government that he has sometimes been called &ldquo;its
second founder,&rdquo; The peculiarities which are most characteristic
of the order were, however, derived from Loyola and Lainez,
rather than from Borgia, whose ideal was a simple monasticism
rather than a life of manifold and influential contact with the
world. He died at Rome on the 30th of September 1572. He
was beatified by Urban VIII. in 1624, and canonized by Clement
X. in 1671, his festival being afterwards (1683) fixed by Innocent
XI. for the 10th of October.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Several works by St Francis Borgia have been published, the
principal of these being a series of <i>Exercises</i> similar to the <i>Exercitia
Spiritualia</i> of Loyola, and a treatise <i>Rhetorica Concionandi</i>. The
<i>Opera Omnia</i> were published at Brussels in 1675. His life was written
by his confessor Pedro de Ribadeneira. See also A. Butler&rsquo;s <i>Lives
of the Saints</i>, and the <i>Breviarium Romanum</i> (second nocturn for
October 10).</p>
